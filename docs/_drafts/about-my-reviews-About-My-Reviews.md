### On Pipe Tobacco Reviews

About my reviews on pipe tobacco I must advise my readers that, unlike most serious reviewers, I don’t plunge into a methodological ritual when smoking a pipe or trying new tobacco.

Some say that such tobacco is best in that kind of pipe or packed in such manner – I don’t believe in those practices. For me, smoking through a tube is the same for any kind of pipe depending of the amount of oxygen that is mixed with the smoke and the health of the tastebuds.

### On Musical Albums Reviews

I do enjoy different types of musical styles. I’ve spent countless hours listening to music, meaning, dedicating my ears and heart to melodies.

Although I’ve listened mostly to metal music in my life, I did develop an ear to good melodies and a talent for playing guitar, as I received previously positive testimonials, I can also compose somewhat good music.

So when I consider that a particular song has a great melody in it and I think that others might like it I jump on my tools and assemble a review for you to read about it. My reviews are usually to be taken lighthearthedly but as far as the music is concerned, I think you will mostly enjoy it.

### On Computer Related Reviews

I’ve spend a lot of time in the last 15 years around my computers and their screens. So I kind of know myself about the subject and, usually, passionate as I’ve always been with IT, I plunge deeply within an aspect of the matter and end up with a good opinion for myself and, usually, for others also.

I’ve been a developer for 10 years and a consultant for 5 years prior stopping working in this field for health reasons. When I give counselling on a certain IT subject it is usually because I studied the matter pretty seriously. But still my reviews as the ones above are to be taken lightly and are meant for readers who are looking for a story rather than a pragmatic guide.
