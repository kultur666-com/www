![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cover2.jpg)It is complete! The wait is no more. A masterpiece is revealed encompassing three albums of a sublime music that is as much delicate and empowering as it can be with music.

The task must have been a bit heavy but the result is rejoicing. **Veilburner** started to enchant us with ‘***The Three Lightbearers***‘, the first album of this trilogy; with not much but talent and musicianship. They poured down an album that would fit in the death metal style, along with touches of industrial metal; parcelled with enchanting melodies, and lets not forget, powerful lyrics(!), as they are the main essence of the three albums.

Followed by ‘***Noumenon***‘, the second installment of the trilogy, as expected, the album ![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cover3.jpg)continues where it had ended.

Here, we are greeted with the same upbeat tempos and same rhythm as ‘***The Three Lightbearers***‘. Nothing strange or outpacing the previous album. It is a continuation of the previous album as we should expect for a trilogy.
