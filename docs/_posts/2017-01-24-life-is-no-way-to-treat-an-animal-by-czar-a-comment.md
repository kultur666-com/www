Out last January 21st 2017 was **Czar**‘s self-released album ‘***Life Is No Way To Treat An Animal***‘, now available in digital format.

A progressive noise act from Tacoma, Washington, USA, **Czar** shares with us their weirdness with a fantastic 46-minutes album that does not fit necessarily into extreme metal but still shreds and screams.

With refreshing riffing and musicality, **Czar** is a must to have in your playlist. If your into Mr. Bungle and Faith No More your gonna love ‘***Life Is No Way To Treat An Animal***‘ by **Czar**. Else have a listen. Available on Bandcamp.
