Last September 12th 2016, was released ***Epitaphs*** by **Obscure Sphinx**, a powerful progressive post-metal.

Led by the voice of Zophia and the rest of the Polish act, the first listen of ***Epitaphs*** is as intriguing as inspiring. A truly flame of passion and warfare inflames the band to produce a unique sound with strong vocals and truly music craftsmanship.

Of course, after a second and third listen we are intrigued of any other production from **Obscure Sphinx**, only to find out that this third instalment is preceded by two previous albums, ***Anaesthetic Inhalation Ritual*** and ***Void Mother***, all in the same vein with high quality music and fabulous vocals by Zophia.

What to say more? Go add the three albums to your playlist right now; youâ€™re missing something. My flavour of the month: **Obscure Sphinx**.
