Out last Halloween, October 31st 2016, was released ‘***The Cursed Travails of the Demeter***‘ EP by **Vircolac** via **Dark Descent Records** in North America and on **Sepulchral Voice** in Europe.

A blackened death metal act from Dublin, Ireland, **Vircolac** delivers a powerful short album with four aggressive songs that dishevels and is sure to please fans of black metal.

Although in the genre of blackened death metal, **Vircolac** wants to bring back the essence of death metal and fuse its origins in what would give us ‘***The Cursed Travails of the Demeter***‘, a cruise that both Dracula and **Vircolac** wants us to take in the journey of death metal from its beginning up until now.

A shorty to please many, ‘***The Cursed Travails of the Demeter***‘ EP by **Vircolac** is available on Bandcamp.
