Out today, Monday February 13th 2017, is ‘***I Become Death***‘ by **Hereza** via **Godz Ov War Productions**.

A death metal act from Croatia, **Hereza** delivers us a powerful album that is in the same veins of *Dismember* and is as heavy as Hell.

Although I got the promo without any press kit I can say that they are a duo and have a previous release, *Misanthrope*, released in 2015.

Also they don’t seem to have a pre-release on Bandcamp but I’ll update this post once I find something. For the moment here’s *Misanthrope* to savour the ‘***I Become Death***‘ by **Hereza** which is highly recommended.
