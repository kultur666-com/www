Smooth, creamy but stout. I donâ€™t know if it was a last batch from the bulk crate but for me it was a stout English with some complex notes of Orientals and something else.

Yet, I enjoyed it. I will have to try the tin hoping it will be a better sample.

My guess is that this is recommended to experienced pipers. The Tobacco might be of high quality but yet it is very complex.

Some aging might be better for flavourful bowls.

> This rare mixture is composed of the finest Latakia, Virginia, Perique, and Oriental tobaccos. Crown Achievement contained Perique in its original form, but this element was removed circa 2004. Lane has once again added Perique, as per the original recipe (tracked down by Leonard Wortzel) to faithfully recreate the storied Crown Achievement of old.
