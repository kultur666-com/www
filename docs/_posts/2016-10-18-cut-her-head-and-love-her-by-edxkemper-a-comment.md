![051_1](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/051_1.jpg)Out last March 13th 2016 was ‘***Cut Her Head And Love Her***‘ EP by **EDxKEMPER** via **Symbol of Domination Productions**.

A 10-tracks EP in under 8 minutes, the songs are hot and grindy. Like a hot potato, they shred the tunes blazingly fast and pass them one-by-one until it ends and you beg for more. The album and band concept is lyrically based on the serial killer Edmund Kemper.

Another cool fact is that the album has been mastered by Dan Swano. The ‘***Cut Her Head And Love Her***‘ EP is well produced and literally too short. Another sweet gem to have in your playlist. And guess what, the album is free on Bandcamp but nothing is preventing you to buy a physical copy to encourage the band.
