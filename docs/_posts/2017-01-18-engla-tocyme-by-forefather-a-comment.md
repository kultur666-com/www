Out tlast January 15th 2017 was the re-release of ‘***Engla Tocyme***‘ by **Forefather** via **Heidens Hart Records**.

A pagan/folk/progressive metal act from UK, **Forefather** delivers us a great melodic album launched originally in 2002 with an extra song, ‘*Loyalty Bound*‘, for the 2017 re-release.

Not a death metal album, although some songs have stronger vocals, **Forefather** with ‘***Engla Tocyme***‘ lets us discover their young talent and makes us curious to listen to some more of their music.

‘***Engla Tocyme***‘ being **Forefather**‘s third release, they have a total of seven releases, the latest being ‘***Curse of the Cwelled***‘, available on Bandcamp, along with ‘***Engla Tocyme***‘ and their other releases. A must to have on your playlist if you like melodic metal and don’t mind some clean vocals.
