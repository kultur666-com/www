One of the first aromatics I bought, Mac Baren’s 7 Seas Regular, was a hole in one as it still is one of my favourite smokes.

Offering a mix of chocolate and vanilla aroma, this tobacco tastes as it smells when puffed and the more you smoke it the more you notice the natural presence of Burley.

Although quite gooey like most aromatics, I noticed that it is best smoked in a straight pipe as it has a tendency to gurgle in a bent one.

As I mentioned in a previous post I’m quite fed up with most aromatics but this one will still be around for evening pipes.

You can find this quite fine tobacco in [100g tins](http://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/mac-baren/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=70213), [16 oz bags](http://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/mac-baren/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=70216) and in [bulk](http://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/mac-baren/bulk/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=70220) at [smokingpipes.com](http://www.smokingpipes.com).
