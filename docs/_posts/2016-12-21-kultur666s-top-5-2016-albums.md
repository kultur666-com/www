A year has past and it’s time for the review of the year once again. Although we reviewed a lot of albums, some of what we’ve been listening to haven’t been reviewed – yet -, and we would like to share it with the world.

We’ve been dealing with promoters and labels this year to see, listen and comment on what’s out from the underground world of metal, and we heard and shared some incredible stuff. Some new band and not so new bands released impressive albums this year and as I mention in the [About Page](http://kultur666.com/about-kultur-666/) of this site, the last two years kept us busy into listening and commenting metal music that totalled and incredible amount of time.

Although some would have liked our top 5 to limit it self to albums that have been reviewed on kultur666.com, not being a sponsored list, we will include only what has caught our attention from all of what we’ve listened and came out in 2016.

So here we go:

## \#5 – Phazm – Scornful Of Icons

![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cover2.jpg?w=680)Another cool album by **Phazm**, ‘***Scornful Of Icons***‘ is probably their best album as they teach new comers how death metal should be played and sang.

With original throat singing and musicality, ‘***Scornful Of Icons***‘ is one of those albums that you get hooked after a first listen.

Along with their other previous albums, we discover this one with the interest to listen to them all.

Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.

## \#4 – Gojira – Magma

![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cover3.jpg?w=680)

Another great album by **Gojira**, ‘***Magma***‘ follows their preceding albums and is as consistent as their previous one, except ‘***Magma***‘ as a unique touch that reaches you that the others don’t have.

We’ve heard the tragedy that stroke the band and maybe that incident is what, involuntarily, affects **Gojira** to put out such album.

A great album full of aggressive melodies and harmonies, ‘***Magma***‘ is one ot the top albums of the year that might have put **Gojira** on the map of metal after their previous mighty efforts.

Available on Spotify.

![thevondeerskullstherestissilencecoverart](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/thevondeerskullstherestissilencecoverart.jpg)

‘***The Rest Is Silence***‘ by **The Von Deer Skulls** is one of those albums that deliciously envelops you with fantasy and gloom by their deep tempos and harsh vocals that only Peter Von Deer Skull knows how to do it.

To be specially listened with dimmed lights and a drink of your choice, ‘***The Rest Is Silence***‘ wins our soul and transports us into a unique place of mystic and nightish skies.

Not for the faint of heart, although the post-metal style is something that isn’t terribly aggressive, the tempos and the deepness of the musicality is not for the newcomer. We loved it on our first listen.

Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.

## \#2 – Obscure Sphinx – Epitaphs

![obscure-sphinx-epitaphs](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/obscure-sphinx-epitaphs.jpg)

Following their previous album, ‘***Epitaphs***‘ by **Obscure Sphinx,** strikes again as a major artistic album.

With the voice and screams of Zophia along the musicianship of the instrumentalists, ‘***Epitaphs***‘ along the previous releases of **Obscure Sphinx** sure is a unique trio where, unlike in the next position of this list, they didn’t release a trilogy but their latest release along the previous two is a powerful triptych of post-metal music and talent.

To be listened on gloomy fall season or in wintery nights. This Polish band sure knows how to tune done the atmosphere.

Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.

## \#1 – Veilburner – The Obscene Rite

![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cover4.jpg)

And in the first place, something that came out not long ago but accomplished a wonderful feature of completing a trilogy that had started two years ago, ‘***The Obscene Rite***‘ by **Veilburner** is what caught most our attention this year.

Not all bands start out on a mission to accomplish a trilogy that will take time, patience and wisdom, but **Veilburner** not only accomplished such work, they created three albums that is the proof that it can be done and we have to thank their professionalism for delivering us such wonderful work of art.

In the spirit of enlightenment and the quest for higher spiritualism, **Veilburner** transports us in the path of transhumanism where one will question itself if such adventure is recommended afterwards.

Continuing where the previous album had left us, ‘***The Obscene Rite***‘ can be listened on its own but we recommend the whole trilogy for the impact of their work of talent and for the sake of artistry and storytelling.

Definitively to have in your playlist. Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.
