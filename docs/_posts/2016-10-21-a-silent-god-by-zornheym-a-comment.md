![zornheym-a-silent-god](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zornheym-a-silent-god.jpg)Released today, Friday October 21st 2016, is the new single by **Zornheym**, ‘***A Silent God***‘ via **Non Serviam Records**.

[Following a previous single, ‘***The Opposed***‘](http://kultur666.com/2016/10/07/the-opposed-by-zornheym-a-comment/), and prior to the forthcoming full-length album, yet to be revealed, we are invited to headbang to this symphonic song that makes us visit an asylum where Zorn and his band mates seams to know how things might go.

Yet another powerful song from **Zornheym**, we can’t wait for the full-length release.

You can get the single ‘***A Silent God***‘ from **Zornheym** on bandcamp.
