Now you must read this… Isn’t it amazing!!!

Fifteen years ago I was already sensing that cars woul dsoon be able to drive autonomously. I was imagining strings of cars following each other and each detaching themselves to individually engage in a turn or highway exit.

I was expecting that soon we wouldn’t be proprietaries of our own cars but would be renters of distances. And that time has almost come. Within the next fifteen years we will see the greatest revolution in the automotive industry since its invention.

But one seat autonomous drones? Now wait a minute… This is even more exciting! Having its own dronepad in our own backward or at the corner of our street with autonomous drones flying around along self-driving cars, now take that Back To The Future!

Renting distances is the near future and it is starting Now!

I’m writing a full article soon on this.
