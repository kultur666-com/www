Released last February 11th, 2022â€“via **Grind to Death Records**, is **Karmanjaka** and their 3rd full-length album: **Gates of Muspel**.

The album follows their latest EP **Hugin** released in 2021.

**Gates of Muspel** is an album that is between *Melodeath* and *Progressive Death Metal*, although it is Death Metal.

I need to consider the fact that **Karmanjaka** started as a one-man-band (which I always admire) in 2016 but evolved rapidly into five mate band soon after.

Cool and interesting album. Karmanjaka needs more attention.

Enjoy!
