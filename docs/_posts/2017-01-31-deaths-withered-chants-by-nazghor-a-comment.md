Out last April 15th 2016, was “***Death’s Withered Chants***” by **Nazghor** via **Satanath Records** and **Obscure Abhorrence Productions**.

A black metal act from Sweden, **Nazghor** is the order below the government of Tartaros and it is the legion of Satan Soldiers of the throne of darkness.

Besides that, they are a quintet of cool dudes who do great black metal and “***Death’s Withered Chants***” is their fifth full-length album. The production is good and they play with melody and powerful vocals.

For fans of black metal in the veins of Watain and Dissection, “***Death’s Withered Chants***” by **Nazghor** is available on Bandcamp.
