Out last September 19th 2016 was ‘***Brotherhood Of Chaos***‘ by **Sectasys** via **Satanath Records** and **Evil’s Records**.

A blackened death metal album from Venezuela, ‘***Brotherhood Of Chaos***‘ by **Sectasys** delivers a powerful sound of darkness with speedy drums and melodic riffs. We sense a thrashy inspiration also in ‘***Brotherhood Of Chaos***‘.

Fans of black metal will enjoy the album and fans of death metal will love its blackness. Available on Bandcamp.
