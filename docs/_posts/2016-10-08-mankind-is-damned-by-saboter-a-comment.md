![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cover1.jpg)Out last July 6th 2016, was **Saboter**‘s first full-length album ‘***Mankind Is Damned***‘ via **Witches Brew** label.

Excelling in the style of 80’s heavy metal in the likes of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, if you’re a fan of those and are looking for modern bands in these styles, **Saboter** is one of the bands you need to listen to.

Very heavy metal-ish with vocals ‘à la’ Dickenson and Halford, along with riffs shredding heavy metal like we used to listen to (am I getting old?), you need to listen to the following Bandcamp streaming widget to get a feel of what I’m talking about and get immersed back in 1987 and bang your head with the devil’s sign and fist in the air. I am getting old…
