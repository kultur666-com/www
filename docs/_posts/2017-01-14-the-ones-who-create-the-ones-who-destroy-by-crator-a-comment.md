Out last September 14th 2016 was self-released ‘***The Ones Who Create, The Ones Who Destroy***‘ by **Crator**.

A technical metal act from New York, USA, **Crator** delivers a powerful album that is on the verge of grind and progressive death.

Using the services of Colin Marston (Gorguts, Krallice), the powerful bass techniques enhances the musicality of the band and makes us loving the album instantly.

Not for the faint of heart, ‘***The Ones Who Create, The Ones Who Destroy***‘ by **Crator** is a good album for lovers of grindcore and technical death metal. Available on Bandcamp.
