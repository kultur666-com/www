Out this Friday March 3rd 2017, is ‘***You Owe You Pay***‘ by **Carnal Decay** via **Rising Nemesis Records**.

A death metal act from Switzerland, **Carnal Decay** are on their fourth full-length release with ‘***You Owe You Pay***‘, a compelling album that has smashing riffs and great guttural vocals.

A great release to happen now, ‘***You Owe You Pay***‘ by **Carnal Decay** might be in my top 10 albums of 2017. A great production with great song writting, this album is a must in your playlist. Available on CD this Friday, you can also get it on Bandcamp and Spotify right now.
