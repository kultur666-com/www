Out today, December 1st 2016, is **Golden Rusk**‘s self-release ‘***What Will Become Of Us?***‘.

An Italian one-man project, one third thrash, one third death and one third industrial, Maher delivers a complete album that he achieves with precision and majesty.

A semi-complex album, the songs are for trained ears and not for the faint of heart. An interesting album if you like distopian themes and is looking for new metal. Contemporary and jetsy, ‘***What Will Become Of Us?***‘ of **Golden Rusk** is a must to listen as the solo project is well produced.
