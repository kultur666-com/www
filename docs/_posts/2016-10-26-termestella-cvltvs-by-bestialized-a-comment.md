Out last May 21st 2016 was ‘***Termestella Cvltvs***‘ by **Bestialized** via **Satanath Records** and **MurdHer Records**.

A well established black metal act of Colombia, ‘***Termestella Cvltvs***‘ is **Bestialized**‘s third full-length album, and having been founded in 2004, **Bestialized** toured since then with big names in South America.

‘***Termestella Cvltvs***‘ is well produced and expect a black metal album with some death spicing. A great album for black metal fans, you can find it on Bandcamp.
