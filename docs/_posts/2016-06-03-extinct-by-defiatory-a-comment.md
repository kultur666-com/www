A new **trash** band in the scene from Sweden, **Defiatory** is launching today, June 3rd, their new full-length album **Extinct** under **Black Lion Productions** label.

A refreshing album, they know their metal and achieve with hummable riffs, solid solos and good metal beats the style not always mastered by today’s trash bands.

With good sound produced from **Garageland Studios** in Umeå, (produced, recoded and mixed by Ronnie Björnström (Aeon, Paganizer)), **Defiatory’s Extinct** album is only a few moments away to become a highly talked production and to push the band into international stardom.

Looking for some new Trash sound? Buy **Extinct** by **Defiatory.**
