Released today, Friday December 9th 2016, is ‘***Magnitude Of Thoughts***‘ by **Teramobil** via **Newcore Music**.

An instrumental experimental/technical death metal album, ‘***Magnitude Of Thoughts***‘ is the second album by the Canadian, Montreal based band, **Teramobil.**

Since their formation in 2010, two members from Unhuman, *Alexandre Dupras* and *Mathieu Bérubé*, along with bassist from BARF, *Dominic ‘Forest’ Lapointe*, and the special guest appearance of *Luc Lemay* from Gorguts join their forces to create an unprecedented scene of aggressive/progressive sound that is sure to please all fans of “nouveau genre” music.

If you like experimental metal, seek **Teramobil**‘s ‘***Magnitude of Thoughts***‘, available now on Bandcamp.
