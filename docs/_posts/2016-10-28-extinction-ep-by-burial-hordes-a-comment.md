Out today Friday October 28th 2016 is **Burial Hordes**‘ ***Extinction*** EP via **Folter Records**.

A deathened black metal band from Greece, **Burial Hordes** is one of those bands that, since their formation in 2001, has kept themselves busy with concerts and recordings and the ***Extinction*** EP is just another way of them showing that they’ll keep our ears bleeding once more.

Doomish one moment and blasting drums the other, the vocals are guttural and the guitars are shredding “à la black” all along.

You can find ***Extinction*** EP by **Burial Hordes** on Bancamp along their three full-length albums.
