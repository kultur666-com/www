Out last September 16th 2016 was released ***Sky*** by **Taiga** via **Symbol Of Domination Productions**.

A depressive/atmospheric black metal band from Russia, the band was founded in the Siberian city of Tomsk by two current members of **Taiga**, Nikolai Seredov and Andrey Chernov, and they produced since 2013 different EPs and an album that led to the release of ***Sky*** in 2016.

If your a fan of DSBM then ***Sky*** by **Taiga** is for you and you can get the album via the **Symbol Of Domination Production** page on Bandcamp.
