Out last May 17th 2016 was **Evil Reborn**‘s ‘***Throne Of Insanity***‘ via **Satanath Records** and **Evil’s Records**.

A death metal band from Venezuela, they shred the album perfectly leaving you gasping for more of its awesomeness.

In 2013 they released an EP, ‘Bendita Malevolencia’, which helped them get more popular in South America and ‘***Throne Of Insanity***‘ is sure to help them get more reconnaissance as they are well talented in the death style.

A great album to have in your playlist, ‘***Throne Of Insanity***‘ is available on Bandcamp.
