Out last December 16th 2016, was ‘***Morbid Creation***‘ by **Inquiring Blood** via **Kernkraftritter Records**.

A death metal act from Hannover, Germany, **Inquiring Blood** released their second full-length album, ‘***Morbid Creation***‘, which is in its own, a well produced album.

Having opened for many high profile bands such as *Aborted*, *Kataklysm* and *Behemoth*, they have lots of gigs under their belt since their inception in 2004.

Although not available on Bandcamp, you can find the album on the **Kernkraftritter Records** Website. Recommended to fans of death metal in general.
