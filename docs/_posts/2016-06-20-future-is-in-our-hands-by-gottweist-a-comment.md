So who likes Pop Metal? I do like Babymetal’s “Gimmie Chocolate” but if there’s some new sound about to explode, it is Pop Metal.

**Gottweist** with “***Future Is In Our Hands***” are one of those bands that doesn’t quite fit in the genre of hard rock/hardcore or heavy metal (except for a few heavy songs). For me they are more of a pop metal band where double bass drums will roll along distorted riffs and ripping solos but the singing and most of the melodies are in the pop “créneau”.

Although you’ll find **Megadeth**-ish inspiration like in “*Bring Me Tonight*” and **Hetfield**-ian vocals throughout the album, they have the talent to pierce into the pop metal/hardcore market and have high radio play.

Keep them coming **Gottweist**.
