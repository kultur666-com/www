Out today, Friday January 27th 2017, is self-released ‘***Battle Through Time***‘ by **Undrask**.

A melodic death metal act from Greensboro, North Carolina, USA, **Undrask** delivers a powerful album in the veins of early In Flames and Amon Amarth.

Their musical talent is reflected in the well played melodies and the album is really well produced. The whole is tight and all instruments sound great. The vocals are more in the range of guttural sounding.

‘***Battle Through Time***‘ by **Undrask** tells the story of someone lost in time, and the music accompanies us through the whole tale. All in all, a great album sure to please a lot of new fans. Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.
