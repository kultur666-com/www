Here’s a band in the same line as Dimmu Borgir for the fans of the latest as I am.

A Black Metal formation from Italy featuring talents from revered previous bands such as Attila Csihar **(MAYHEM)**, Niklas Kvarforth **(Shining)**, Sakis Tolis **(Rotting Christ)** and Labes C. Necrothytus **(Abysmal Grief)**; these artists put their efforts into a single great album sure to please fans of symphonic/melodic black metal.

Expect pretty much the same musicality as Dimmu Borgir style yet without the revered Galder musicianship.

Here’s a video to sharpen the ears; *On The Defunct* by **Darkend**:

Album coming out April 25th, 2016.
