![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cover.jpg?w=680)Out last August 26th 2016, was **Cognizance**‘s latest self-released EP, ***Illusory***.

A powerful technical death metal EP, they keep doing their studio stuff with high quality musicianship and great talent.

Expect technicality like the other well renowned bands in the empowering style of tech death like Necrophagist, but an itsy-bitsy more melodic. At least that’s my opinion.

For those who would like to see them live, they seem to not venture in that direction as they mention in the Gear Gods interview below, as they focus mainly to deliver high quality studio recordings and they haven’t the resources to do touring and do full-length albums also.

But you can listen to their EPs through the following Bandcamp streaming widget and buy, buy, buy, as they produce greatness that licks our eardrums with delicacy.
