An oldie but a goodie, ****Gnaw Their Tongues**** with ***I speak the truth, yet with every word uttered, thousands die*** released in 2020 (so not so far off).

The album is quite harsh like most **Gnaw Their Tongues** albums. I’m not sharing the harshest and quite bitter album that I’m reserving for a futur post, but this one is one of the least difficult to hear, believe it or not.

Enjoy!
