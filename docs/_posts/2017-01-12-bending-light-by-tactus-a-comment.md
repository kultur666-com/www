Out last October 7th 2016 was self-released ‘***Bending Light***‘ by **Tactus**.

A five member band of progressive metal from Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, ‘***Bending Light***‘ is **Tactus**‘ first full-length release following two EPs previously released in 2014 and 2015, and featuring their unique talent to fuse jazzy musicality and rock atmosphere.

Some clean singing along guttural vocals, ‘***Bending Light***‘ by **Tactus** is an excellent album for those who enjoy heavy music and appreciate music performance that goes beyond your regular mainstream heavy metal.

Highly recommended. Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.
