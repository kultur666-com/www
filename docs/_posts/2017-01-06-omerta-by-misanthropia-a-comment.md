Out today Friday January 6th 2017 is ***Omerta*** by **Misanthtropia** through the **Via Nocturna** label.

**Misanthropia** is a band from the Netherlands formed in 2006 and ***Omerta*** is their 3rd full-length album.

A symphonic black metal act, **Misanthropia** has achieved to give us a really nice album which is well written and well produced.

With the help of *Mike Wead* (lead-guitarist of, among others, King Diamond, Mercyful Fate, Bibleblack, Nattas) **Misanthropia** is sure to make their fame a bit shinier where fans of symphonic black metal will most likely enjoy **Omerta**. Available on Bandcamp.
