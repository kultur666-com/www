Out tomorrow Friday January 6th 2017 is ***Via*** by **Derhead** through the label **Via Nocturna**.

An Italian black metal band, they are launching their first EP with some bonus tracks, previous demos launched in 2003 and 2013.

The ***Via*** EP is well produced and the songs are well written, giving us fresh black metal as the songs are original compared to some other formations.

If youâ€™re a fan of black metal and is looking for some new material, ***Via*** by **Derhead** is highly recommended. Available on Bandcamp to stream before buying.
