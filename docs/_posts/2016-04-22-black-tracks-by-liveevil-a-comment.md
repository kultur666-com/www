A cool band with some melodic songs, Liveevil delivers nice tunes as I consider their band having a Pop Power Metal genre.

Although they are from Czech origin, they have a strong German sound making them beneficial for a solid hit in the years to come.

Having not heard from them before, I really think they are poised to become big. Their album, “*Black Tracks*“, is due out in 2016 but it has only been since 2013 they are on the road; making them all available for an international acclamation and reconnaissance for their talent.

Here’s “Devilation” from their latest album:
