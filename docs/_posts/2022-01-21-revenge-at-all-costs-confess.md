After 18 months of imprisonment in Iran for being bullheaded metal artists, **Confess** seeked asylum in Norway and are back with a new album **Solid-As-F\*ck** : ***Revenge At All Costs*** released today, January 21st 2022!

Reminiscent of late 90s metal aka, *Slipnot*, *Sepultura*, *Pantera* and *Machine Head*, the album is loaded with heavy grooves and sustained shredding.

Enjoy !
