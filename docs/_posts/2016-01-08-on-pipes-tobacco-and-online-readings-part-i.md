For over a year I’ve been passionate about pipe tobacco and pipe smoking. I bought my first pipes in 2007 when I had stopped smoking cigarettes (for the 20th time I think) and as I was shopping for cigars at Montreal’s Blatter &amp; Blatter Tobacconist. I looked at the pipe basket on the counter, where they had different pipes on sale, and grabbed one telling myself: “I would like to try one on these”.

My previous landlord was a big pipe smoker. I don’t know if he still smokes them but back then I was telling myself: “since I do like the tobacco pipe odour as it smelled at Michel’s, I might like it also”. So I grabbed a Genot bent billiard and a pouch of English house blend as recommended by the old man behind the cash register and went back home with the idea that I might had made a mistake spending 60$ on both items.

Back at home, I lit up my new pipe and tried to enjoy my new hobby. An English blend was the first mistake of my improvised shopping. I didn’t like it very much. But still I insisted that I had to keep trying so I put the pipe aside and gave myself time to learn how to pipe smoke.

Now my memory is a bit failing as I don’t remember exactly why, but I bought a second pipe afterwards with, I think, a second pouch of the same blend. I kept puffing once in a while with the idea that I would become a pipe smoker. All in all I ended up giving up pipe smoking, reverting back to cigarettes and giving what I had left of the pipe tobacco to a friend who regularly smoked it also and storing my pipes within a drawer telling myself that at least I had tried but still the idea was sticking that maybe one day I would give another try to it.

Fast forward 7 years later, I was looking to satisfy my appetite for tobacco when I thought about my pipes and decided to give it another shot. A a Goal it was!

Although pipe tobacco had almost doubled its price in 7-8 years, for a month I smoked 10g of tobacco per day. I started with a low-profile aromatic which I enjoyed a lot in the beginning, but being half able to work due to some health issues, I need to find a way to get cheaper tobacco.

In my searches I found cheaper and much better tobacco than that newbie low-fi aro. Along the way I learned a lot about pipe tobacco and found a keen interest in my new vice.

Fast forward to today, I still have a lot to learn on pipes and tobacco but Dear God have I spent much time looking into this subject. So much that I became almost (almost) an intermediate knower on pipes and pipe tobacco in one and a half year.

So, all the text above is to lead to the links below about my favourite sites on pipe tobacco, tobacco pipes and some of them related to tobacco in general. I’ll present in the following lines the links with a section title, a link title, a link description and finally the link at the end, so you all might have the right info on those sites as a reference to any further research of reading you might like to do.
