These coins offer a grassy taste from the Virginia and a stronger stout taste from the Dark-Fired.

Overall it is a fantastic smoke where one who likes Virginia taste along some Dark-Fired Kentucky will find this smoke to be a win-win scenario in terms of natural tasting tobacco.

I usually enjoy this kind of tobacco in the evenings although for the moment Iâ€™m not the kind who fully appreciates Virginias on their own.

I recommend this tobacco to experienced pipers and Virginia lovers although if you are a beginner and looking for a natural tasting tobacco, this one serves well the curious.
