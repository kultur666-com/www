Out tomorrow, November 25th 2016, is ‘***Through Realms Unseen***‘ by **Entrapment** via **Pulverised Records**.

A death metal act from the Netherlands,’***Through Realms Unseen***‘ by **Entrapment** is a truly a powerful album where song after song we are propulsed into melodic and grind distortion where the songs are well arranged and the production is “numero uno”.

This is **Entrapment**‘s third full-length album where their journey since 2009 has been a busy one and their discography is abundant.

Truly an album to obtain and listen quite a lot, you can find Entrapment on Bandcamp.
