![endemise_anathema](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/endemise_anathema.jpg?w=680)Out this Friday October 28th 2016, is **Endemise**‘s new full-length album, ***Anathema***, released via **Maple Metal Records**.

A blackened death metal act from Ottawa, Canada, they deliver us a solid album that is as symphonic as it is aggressive.

Having toured with big names and ***Anathema*** being their second full-length album, **Endemise** is one of the bands to have in our playlist. You can find **Endemise**‘s ***Anathema*** and first full-length album ***Far From The Light*** on Bandcamp.
