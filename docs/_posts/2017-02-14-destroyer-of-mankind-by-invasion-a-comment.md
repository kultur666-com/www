Out this Friday, February 17th 2017, is ‘***Destroyer Of Mankind***‘ by **Invasion** via **Abyss Records**.

A death metal act from Indiana, USA, **Invasion**‘s ‘***Destroyer Of Mankind***‘ is a really good album that you must have a listen to, and, although I didn’t find any Bandcamp page, the album is a real breakthrough that might make it one of the best death metal albums of 2017, so let’s hope they make it accessible through streaming services.

The riffs are catchy and the solos are really awesome. The whole album is a mechanical riff packed death machine.

‘***Destroyer Of Mankind***‘ by **Invasion** is awesome and a must-have for your playlist this year.
