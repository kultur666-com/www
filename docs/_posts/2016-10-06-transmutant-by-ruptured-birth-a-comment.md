![ruptured-birth-coverart](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ruptured-birth-coverart.jpg)Out last September 23rd 2016, was **Ruptured Birth**‘s ***Transmutant*** via **CDN Records**.

A death metal album on the verge of brutal slam, the act from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, delivers a powerful album that shreds and tears the walls apart.

Having formed in 2014, **Ruptured Birth** has already a previous EP released, ‘***Arachni Supremacy***‘ which is included in the digital package on Bandcamp. They have toured in and around Ontario and are booked up until the Holidays, so checkout if they’re coming near you.
