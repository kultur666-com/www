Out today, Monday February 13th 2017, is the reissue of ‘***The Rotten Ways Of Human Misery***‘ by **Blackthorn** via **Chaos Records**.

A death metal act from Mexico, **Blackthorn** is non existent since 1994 but their legend still lives through this album as it is their first and only full-length album.

An album that has been remastered early 2016 and the production sounds awesome for a 1992 album. And if you’re a fan of old school death metal bands, ‘***The Rotten Ways Of Human Misery***‘ album by **Blackthorn** is a must to get. Sounds as good as *Death* and early 90’s death bands. A must to have on your playlist.

No pre-release yet on Bandcamp, I’ll update this post if it ever finds its way there.
