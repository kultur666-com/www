![Urobilinemia - Cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/urobilinemia-cover.jpg)Here’s a gem like once in a while is found and, tickling our ears, new music emerges and a new inspiration leads on.

**Urobilinemia** is a technical brutal death metal Japanese band which are launching their new EP album (may I say their first album although they have launched previously a split album) on July 22nd 2016.

Featuring six new songs plus four songs of the previous split launch, the album starts with a calm melody leading next to a rhythmic-melodic brutal distorted symphony accompanied of deep guttural grunts, which the album is to become famous for them. The vocals on most of the album feature what can be considered the most extreme sounds a human can make. On the sixth song we are presented with what can be the fantasy of all death metal deep guttural vocalist. Vocals are so deep that they are vented out from the intestines and bubbling out through the stomachal bile (or such as we can think of the most extreme deep guttural sound one could make if he swallowed microphone and pushed his internal gases upwards).

A refreshing album is **Urobilinemia**‘s ‘***Wriggling Chrysalis Of Metaphysical Grudge***‘. A band to be followed in the next couple of months and years if the singer endures the harsh treatment he inflicts to his guts and vocal cords.

Buy their album, it is a must!
