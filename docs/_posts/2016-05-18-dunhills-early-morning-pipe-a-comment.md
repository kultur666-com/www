My go-to tobacco for my first of the day pipe is *Sutliff’s 203 Heavy English*, as it delivers a good Latakia kick to wake you up and prepare your tastebuds for the coming nice pipes until it’s time to go to bed again.

If you have a bigger tobacco budget than me, then *Dunhill’s Early Morning Pipe* should be your go-to pipe for first pipe of the day. And it would be for me if I had the wallet for it. But yet again *203 Heavy English* is a good tobacco that I enjoy quite well.

If you enjoy Dunhill’s fine tobaccos, you probably already enjoy EMP. But else, I encourage you to try it along *My Mixture 965* as they compliment each other as great tobaccos for all-morning and all-day smokes.

> For Dunhill’s Early Morning Pipe, sweet Oriental is carefully blended with Bright and Red Virginias, then pressed and lightly stoved. It’s great as the first pipe of the day, waking the palate for the further pleasures of the day.
