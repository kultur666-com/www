Out today October 14th 2016 is the band **Life’s December** new release, ‘***Fatigue’***, via **Dark Wings**.

‘***Fatigue***‘ is **Life’s December** second full-length album, after an acclaimed debut album, ‘Colder’.

A Swiss born band, ‘***Fatigue***‘ features a Deathcore style along a djenty swing. They recorded ‘***Fatigue***‘ on their own and the sound is impeccable. A proof there’s no excuse for really bad sounding albums.

Although ‘***Fatigue***‘ is not yet on Bandcamp, you can stream their previous album ‘Colder’ and have an idea of their music.
