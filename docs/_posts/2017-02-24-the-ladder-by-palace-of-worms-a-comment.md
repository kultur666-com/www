Out last February 17th 2017, was the CD version of ‘***The Ladder***‘ by **Palace of Worms** via **Acephale Winter Productions**.

Featuring a progressive black metal sound, **Palace of Worms** is the work of a one-man band, *Balan*, where he composes and plays all the music.

In the veins of melodic black metal bands but with a progressive sound, Balan transports us in an atmospheric and aggressive ballad.

‘***The Ladder***‘ is **Palace of Worms** third full-length album.

Highly recommended to fans of progressive black metal, ‘**The Ladder**‘ is available on Bandcamp.
