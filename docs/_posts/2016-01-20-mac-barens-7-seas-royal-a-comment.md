The Mac Baren’s 7 Seas Royal blend is a tobacco with some fruity casing delivering a wonderful aroma on the tin’s opening.

Its taste is quite jolly. The end. The rest depends of the aromatic smoker and how he likes the aromatic tobacco taste. For me I like when a natural taste of the tobacco, usually the Burley, pops out frome the casing taste, giving the aromatic a personality which I think is important in any kind of tobacco smoking.

The 7 Seas Royal blend smells and tastes great but once you’re at mid bowl, your tongue starts to tingle, raising an alarm that the casing is a bit too overpowering and killing the natural flavours.

I recommend this blend to the experienced aromatic smokers. Newbies beware of the enticing aroma.
