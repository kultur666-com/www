Today I’ve decided to tackle this fine flake, although, as I have mentioned before, I don’t enjoy Virginia tobacco as it should. Its grassy taste doesn’t reach my pleasure neurons as Dark-Fired or Burley does.

So I got this sample from the previous month order. Two flakes of No. 400 Superior Navy Flake from Newminster.

I usually enjoy Newminster’s tobaccos as I have in the past, with natural taste tobaccos, such as No.403 Superior Round Slices and No. 17 English Luxus (please don’t ask me to try aromatic tobaccos) and as usual they are fine-good tobaccos.

As for No. 400 Superior Navy Flake, having as usual, smoked a bowl before writing down some review, I did somewhat enjoyed the smoke but yet it’s still not my favourite to be in my rotation.

Smooth and woodsy, No. 400 Superior Navy Flake seems to be one of a kind after reading some reviews. If you like Virginia flakes I guess you’re going to love this one. For me, I ain’t there yet.
