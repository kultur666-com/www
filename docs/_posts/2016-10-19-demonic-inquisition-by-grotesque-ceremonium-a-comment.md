![153-1](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/153-1.jpg)Out last June 15th 2016 was released ‘***Demonic Inquisition***‘ by **Grotesque Ceremonium** via **Satanath Records** and **More Hate Productions**.

A band from Ankara, Turkey, **Grotesque Ceremonium** began as a solo project which led to a self-released tape, ‘***Blasphemous Goat Observance***‘ and led to ‘***Demonic Inquisition***‘ first full-length album release.

Particularly centered around old-school death metal with Satanic themes, ‘***Demonic Inquisition***‘ relates its lyrics to medieval history of a demonic inquisition.

You can find **Grotesque Ceremonium** on Bandcamp for streaming and buying the ‘***Demonic Inquisition***‘ album and the ‘***Blasphemous Goat Observance***‘ EP.
