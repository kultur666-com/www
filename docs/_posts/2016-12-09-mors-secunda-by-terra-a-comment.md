Out today, Friday December 9th 2016, is ‘***Mors Secunda***‘ by **Terra** via **Code666**.

‘***Mors Secunda***‘ is two lengthy songs of atmospheric black metal style. Played by three Englishmen, they achieve to transport us through darkness and aggressiveness along some post-rock sounds and drone vibes.

A cool album by **Terra** to have on its playlist, if you’re a fan of atmospheric black metal; the songs are well written and can be enjoyed by any fan of extreme music. Available on Bandcamp.
