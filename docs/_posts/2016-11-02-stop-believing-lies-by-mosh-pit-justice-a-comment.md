Released Last October 31st 2016, was ‘***Stop Believing Lies***‘ by **Mosh-Pit Justice** via **Witches Brew**.

A trash/power metal band from Bulgaria, **Mosh-Pit Justice** released a real old-school album in the veins of Anthrax and Overkill, with power chords and speedy drums.

A really cool album in the movement of the new wave of thrash metal, a must for your playlist if you’re into the all new and old thrash metal sound.
