Out this Friday, February 17th 2017, is ‘***Identity Shapes***‘ EP by **Deadwound** via **Black Bow Records**.

A hardcore/sludge quintet from South West London, UK, **Deadwound** delivers a powerful EP that is in between doom stock and stoner metal but definitely in the veins of rocker sludge.

A heavy packed five piece EP, ‘***Identity Shapes***‘ by **Deadwound** is a great album if you’re looking for something new, with low guitars and harsh vocals.

The production really good for the kind of music, lets hope we see a Bandcamp page soon.
