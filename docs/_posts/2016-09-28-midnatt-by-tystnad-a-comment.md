![tystnad-midnatt-cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tystnad-midnatt-cover.jpg)Out last September 16th 2016 was **Tystnad**‘s ***Midnatt album***, a self-released black metal album from a Swedish one man act.

For core fans of black metal, **Midnatt** revolves around disaster and darkness themes enveloped by melodic riffs and aggressive beats.

Sometimes featuring slower tempos with deep thought lyrics, **Tystnad**‘s ***Midnatt*** album surely shreds one’s ears.

Having launched two EPs in 2015, ***Midnatt*** is **Tystnad**‘s first full-length album and you can stream it with the Bandcamp widget below. Listen and buy it if it is your kind of mood today.
