Out today, Monday February 13th 2017, is the eponymous album of **Miserist** via **Krucyator Productions**.

An instrumental experimental black/death metal act from Australia, **Miserist** has been inspired by a children asylum documentary to exist and produce this inspiring but dark album that has some influences on the latest *Gorguts* and any other instrumental DBSM bands you can imagine.

A recommended album to fans of extreme metal, especially experimental instrumental death metal curious. Available on Bandcamp.
