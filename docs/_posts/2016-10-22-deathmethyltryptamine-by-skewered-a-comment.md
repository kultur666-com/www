Out yesterday, Friday October 21st 2016 was ***Deathmethyltryptamine*** by **Skewered** via **Stillbirth Records**.

An Irish band that knows how to make really good death metal, the title of the album makes us think that they must be good dealers of death methyl. And they are. With original riffing and vocalizations, the album is refreshing and is a good one to re-listen once it has ended. The album cover is quite cool also.

The album ***Deathmethyltryptamine*** by **Skewered** is available on bandcamp.
