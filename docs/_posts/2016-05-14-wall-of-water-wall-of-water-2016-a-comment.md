**![album](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/album.jpg)WALL OF WATER** features musicians Cullen Toner (Vocals, Guitars, Bass and Keyboards) from New Jersey Black Metal band **Abazagorath**, and drummer Shawn Eldridge from the Death Metal band **Disma** (Profound Lore Records).

Delivering a full-blast first album, **Wall Of Water** self-released last tuesday (May 10th, 2016) their eponymous album through their Bandcamp page.

Although the sound could be better, still they deliver good melodic songs in the general style of Nordic black metal along some groovy riffs and a broad djenty background.
