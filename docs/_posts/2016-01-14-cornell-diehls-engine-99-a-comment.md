A good full flavoured English, although light in Perique as it was what I was looking for; Engine 99 can be classified as a mountain blend as the following citation from SmokingPipes.com’s blend description.

I also find it to be light on the Latakia. Overall a good mellow English blend with Oriental flavours coming out mostly from the whole blend.

> A full bodied blend with enough Latakia to pull ol’ #99 up a mountain grade with flavor to spare. Loaded with Latakia, Perique, Virginias, Burleys, and Orientals.

I would recommend it to newbies who wish to try a lighter mountain blend. Else a generally good English blend containing some Perique.
