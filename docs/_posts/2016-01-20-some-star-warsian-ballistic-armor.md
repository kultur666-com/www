Here’s some cool stuff for those interested in body and balistic armor and, why not, some cosplay.

Body armor manufacturer [AR500 Armor](http://www.ar500armor.com/) is working in conjuction with other manufacturers on making balistic armor pretty much looking like Jango Fett and his little clone friends.

Pretty cool but I wonder if it ain’t doing a little too much. We’ll see in the future if any clones becomes mainstream and if an invasion is necessary of such.
