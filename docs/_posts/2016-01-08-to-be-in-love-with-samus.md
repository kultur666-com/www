I saw the following video a few months ago where it seems some dudes are trying to get some funds for a Metroid movie with this promo/teaser.

I liked it a lot even though some said that Jessica Chobot (playing Samus Aran) wasn’t acting well… I’m sorry but she is really great. So great that I would love to see a full featured movie with her as Samus which I don’t think will happen.
