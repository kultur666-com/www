Out today, December 3rd 2016, is ***Bloodfields EP*** by **Wormlight** via **Black Lion Records**.

It is in fact a re-release of the previous EP with two bonus tracks with the new vocalist, or actually, a member that replaced the previous vocalist, Tiamat Invictuz, which is also guitarist of **Wormlight**.

If you’ve been following **Wormlight** you can hear Tiamat Invictuz sing the two songs *Wormlight* and *The Bloodfields* and you’ll see that he brings a new dimension with his all-powerful voice.

**Wormlight** is in the process of recording their first full-length album to be out in 2017. Meanwhile you can have a glimpse with this ***Bloodfields EP***.
