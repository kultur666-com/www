Out last December 24th 2016 was ‘***Banging on the Pentagram***‘ by **Evil Force** via the **Witches Brew** label.

A thrash/speed metal act from Asuncion, Paraguay, **Evil Force** was founded in 2005 with acoustic guitars and book covers and a bed mattress as the drums. Things got eventually more serious and a decade and two full-length releases later, they got signed with **Witches Brew** label and a few months later ‘***Banging on the Pentagram***‘ was released.

**Evil Force** delivers an 80s old-school thrash/speed metal style that can be obscured by the other bands of the same style, but what catches our attention with **Evil Force**, is their talent to write the style with melody and good tempo. The riffs are catchy and the production delivers for the format.

Recommended if your into old-school thrash/speed metal. Available on Bandcamp.
