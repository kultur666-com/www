![Digipak 6P 1CD](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/extamalorum_digipak.jpg)

Out today, Friday November 4th 2016, is ‘***Exta Malorvm***‘ by **Nebrus** via **Razed Soul Productions**.

A doomish black metal band from Italy, **Nebrus** is in fact a duo of *Mortifero*, which does most of the instrumental side of the tracks, and *Noctuaria* doing the vocals.

***Exta Malorvm*** is **Nebrus**‘ second full-length album, the first one released in 2012 with good criticts.

Although in the veins of DSBM, ***Exta Malorvm*** is somewhat a good album with good vibes and dark themes. For fans of black metal, you can find ***Exta Malorvm*** by **Nebrus** on Bandcamp.
