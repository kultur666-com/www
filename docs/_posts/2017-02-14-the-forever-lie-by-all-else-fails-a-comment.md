Out this Friday, February 17th 2017, is ‘***The Forever Lie***‘ by **All Else Fails** via **Suicidal Bride Records**.

A heavy metal/hardcore act from Edmonton, Canada, **All Else Fails** delivers another powerful album with ‘***The Forever Lie***‘ which translates to the ever calling American Dream, and **All Else Fails** sings and screams it with tight beats and great distortion.

Although I prefer to present here non-clean singing bands, **All Else Fails** shares their tunes in between melodic vocals and heavy throat screaming which, along with the heavy music, makes a combination of great musicianship; and the album must be praised for what it is and is to be highlighted for its awesomeness. A must to have in your playlist if you’re not a hardliner on extreme metal and enjoy some clean vocals.

Available on Bandcamp.
