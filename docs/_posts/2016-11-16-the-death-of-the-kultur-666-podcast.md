So yes, after a matured thinking, and also, after [previously mentioning it](http://kultur666.com/2016/11/09/no-kultur-666-podcast-episode-this-week/), the **Kultur 666 Podcast** is dead and buried.

There are far better ways now to discover new music and we encourage you to use them such as the radio stations as promoted by on-demand streaming music services.

We want to thank the followers of the **Kultur 666 Podcast** and we will keep feeding you with reviews here on kultur666.com.

**Thank you &amp; !,,!\_ Metal On \_!,,!**
