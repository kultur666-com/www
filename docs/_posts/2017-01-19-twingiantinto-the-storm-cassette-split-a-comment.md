Out this Friday January 20th 2017, is a split cassettes by **Twingiant** and **Into The Storm** via **Tridroid Records**.

Two roaded sludge/stoner/heavy rock bands, releasing a common intro cassette for the masses; both bands share with us a pinch of their talent so that we discover their talent, and talent they have.

A nice intro into their music, discover both bands and surf their pages on Bandcamp as their albums are available for streaming.
