Out today, Thursday December 8th 2016, is ‘***Devoured By Damnation***‘ by **Kratornas** via **Grathila Records**.

Essentially a death metal album, **Kratornas** is the brainchild of *Zacharias* who, prior immigrating to Canada, has had a really rough life in the Philippines where having a passion for metal was not easy and launching a proper album was also difficult prior to ‘***Deavoured By Damnation***‘.

Now, **Kratornas** can exploit all their talents to share with us their aggressive music and ‘***Devoured By Damnation***‘ is the best way for us to discover it. A well produced album, ‘***Devoured By Damnation***‘ is a well written album where influences of old Sepultura along Deicide can be found to please death metal fans.

A good album to have in your playlist, ‘***Devoured By Damnation***‘ by **Kratornas** can be found on Bandcamp.
