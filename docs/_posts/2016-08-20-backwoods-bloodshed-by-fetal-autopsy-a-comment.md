Out March 25th 2016 was ‘***Backwoods Bloodshed***‘ by **Fetal Autopsy** via **Meathook Records.** A one man band, *Ray Bell* from Oklahoma City*;* he got to produce a well recorded death metal album with some fine catchy and rhythmic songs as we usually like them.

With ‘*Left To Rot*‘, ‘*Dennis The Menace*‘, ‘*Mummified Putrefaction*‘ and ‘*Awaiting The Slaughter…*‘, he achieves with musicality and pounding aggressiveness to put down memorable tunes. Along with some speech sampling here and there, he gives us a fine death album that should also reach the general metal fan base.

Even though you will find **Fetal Autopsy** on Soundcloud, you will find most of his albums on Bandcamp as the following streaming of ‘***Backwoods Bloodshed***‘ that I invite you to listen and buy.
