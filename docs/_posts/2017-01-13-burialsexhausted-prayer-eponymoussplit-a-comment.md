Out today Friday January 13th 2017 is a split eponymous album by **Burials** and **Exhausted Prayer** via **Apes Who Looked Up** and **Rose Quarter Records.**

A half death metal and half blackened death metal album with original riffs and musicality, the **Burials**/**Exhausted Prayer** split the a kind of album that you get the hang of it really quickly and you love after a listen.

A great album to have in your playlist, the first half of the split is played by **Burials**. From Portland, Oregon, USA, they ingeniously play four songs which are well written and bring fresh sounds to our ears. A bit half progressive with aggressive beats, the guttural vocals of the singer goes along pretty well with the awesome musicianship of the band.

The other half played by **Exhausted Prayer**, from Los Angeles, USA, presents us great blackened death metal which fits nicely with the **Burials** songs. A bit less progressive but utterly awesome, Exhausted Prayer delivers pounding blasted drums and great screaming vocals. The riffing is excellent and the melodies are well written. A band to watch for they have great talent.

A must to listen, I highly recommend this album to death and black metal fans. A well recorded album, available on Bandcamp.
