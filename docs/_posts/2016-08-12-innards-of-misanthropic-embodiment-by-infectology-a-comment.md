Coming out this Friday, August 12th 2016, is ‘***Innards Of Misanthropic Embodiment***‘ by **Infectology** from **Gore House Productions**.

A quartet from Ecuador, they exist since 2009 and ‘**Innards Of Misanthropic Embodiment**‘ is their second full-length album after ‘**Origin of Pathological Extermination**‘ that came out in 2013 and a split appearance in 2015.

In the veins of some old Kataclysm, Cryptopsy and Gastrorrexis, **Infectology** is a brutal death act that offers us a great album that extreme metal fans just like to own.

Listen to the streaming below to have a taste of their album and don’t forget to buy for it to be in your playlist.
