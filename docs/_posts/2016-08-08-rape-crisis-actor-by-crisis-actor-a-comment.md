Hereâ€™s a quicky.

A few weeks ago, while reading some articles on [MetalInjection.net](http://www.metalinjection.net/), I stumbled upon an article mentioning **Crisis Actor** on Bandcamp and their three song album ***Rape Crisis Actor***.

After a hearing I loved it immediately and bought it.

The first thing that came to mind was some good old **Brutal Truth** which I saw in 1996 or 1997 for their ***Trend Kill Suicide*** album. The whole show was surreal.

So back to **Crisis Actor**; I think Brutal Truth fans will like them. They are a duo formed by Nick Cacioppo on vocals and Kishor Haulenbeek on the rest of the music and backing vocals. The whole album is f\*#@ing great.

Get it on Bandcamp. They let you choose the amount you pay for the album; be generous.
