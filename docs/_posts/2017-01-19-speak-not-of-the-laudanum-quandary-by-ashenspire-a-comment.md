Out this Friday January 20th 2017, is ‘***Speak Not Of The Laudanum Quandary***‘ by **Ashenspire** via **Code666**.

A heavy rock British act, Ashenspire is a mix of folk, rock and DBSM, where the music still holds as heavy metal but the vocals requires our attention as the stories unfolds and the clean lamenting singing leads our ears into a human odyssey.

If you’re into DBSM and are looking for some more down to earth singing and want to be transported into a journey of harrowing journey, get ‘***Speak Not Of The Laudanum Quandary***‘ by **Ashenspire**.

Available on Bandcamp.
