Out today, Friday January 20th 2017, is self-released ***Asunder*** EP by **Samskaras**.

A death metal act from Montreal, Canada, Samskaras is a project of Eric Burnet (**Derelict**, **Unburnt**) with the joint collaboration of Alexandre Dupras, known for his work with **Teramobil** and **Unhuman**.

A tour-de-force is this EP, where the musicianship of the two members delivers a very powerful EP and where the tunes are technically played, leaving us begging for more. Let’s hope for a full length album very soon. Highly recommended.

If you’re seeking for something new, seek out ***Asunder*** by **Samskaras**. Visit their Bandcamp page for ***Asunder*** and previous releases of **Samskaras** and the new EP.
