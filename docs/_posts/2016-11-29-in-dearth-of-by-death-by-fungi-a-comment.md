Out last May 7th 2016, was self-released ‘***In Dearth Of***‘ EP by **Death By Fungi**.

A fun thrash/punk metal album with some powerful songs, although a shorty, it is an interesting album to have in your playlist.

**Death By Fungi** is a band from Mumbai, India, since 2013 and they deliver interesting riffs to the style. A song to not miss is ‘*Pathfinder*‘ as it is a really good one to listen to.

They are available on Bandcamp, as usual, be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">generous</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">buy</span>.
