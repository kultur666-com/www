Robotics has quite evolved for the last fifty years, yet, there is still a huge amount of work needed before we see them taking care of ourselves as many Japanese efforts are put toward this objective.

And then there is Atlas from Boston Dynamics (owned by Alphabet) along his big and little robot friends. As you will see in the next video, there has been a good step taken towards equilibrium and I did get all emotional when I saw their creators kick them and try to fool them.

After all, Atlas doesn’t care if he is tricked, but one day he might be. And let’s not become barbarians with robots and respect them for what they are: Creatures.
