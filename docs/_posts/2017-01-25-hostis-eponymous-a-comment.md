Released last August 10th 2016 was the eponymous album by **Hostis** via **Miner Recordings**.

A death metal act from Montenegro, **Hostis** is a pen name for the members of **Abhoth**. A band lyrically focusing on social issues, their music displays all of their talent as music writers and the album well produced.

Founded in 2010, **Hostis** is a trio with Srđan Mišović (vocals and drum programming) , Miloš Klikovac (guitars) and Aleksandar Dragojević (bass guitar). Miloš left the band last year and was replaced with Luka Bošković (Polar Shift, ex-Abzofran). They are preparing the release of their second full-length album.

Available on Bandcamp.
