![artwork](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/artwork1.jpg)Out this Thursday, September 29th 2016 is ‘***Unholy Ghost Liturgy***‘, a split album of **Abigorum** and **Cryostasium** via the **Satanath Records** and **Abstruse Eerie Radiance** labels.

A psychedelic/ambient blackish metal style, ‘***Unholy Ghost Liturgy***‘ is a refreshing album featuring some unusual songs yet some yielding new sounds and new concepts of extreme music.

A must for collectors of metal albums, the joint effort of **Abigorum** and **Cryostasium** is a sure pleasure to listen is you’re a fan of extreme music and audio art.

I invite you to listen to the Bandcamp streaming widget below and have a listen for yourself. My favorite song is *Systematic Apocalypse* and I’m sure you’ll love it too.
