Awesome! If you’re like me and like Cuban maduro cigars, or I mean like a full-bodied one from elsewhere, you’ll love this tobacco. A mix of dark-fired and air cured Virginias; this stuff is matured to be smoked as soon you get it, or even better, aged for some more maturity as many suggest.

A strong aroma and taste, I wonder if it gets any better than this. My top tobacco used to be Peterson’s Irish Flake but this one is either as good or better.

Novices should once in a while try it but it is meant for experienced pipers. Expensive but awesome.
