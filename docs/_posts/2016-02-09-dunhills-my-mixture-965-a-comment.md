Dunhill’s My Mixture 965 offers a creamy and smooth English smoke. The Latakia is faded by the Orientals and the Cavendish.

G.L. Pease said in one of his articles that the Dunhill tobacco’s used to have a particular pungent aroma that I think is still a bit discernable in our days, but I have only smoked the bulk format so I’d better try the tin before saying anything more. Else it is a classic smoke that has the right to be hyped and I know why everybody loves it now.

Recommended to all levels of pipers.

> Dunhill’s My Mixture 965 is for the connoisseurs of full-bodied tobacco. Choicest small Latakia impart a rich nutty flavor and coolness. Macedonia Bright is added for sweetness. The Brown Cavendish completes the blend that all confirmed pipe smokers love.

Available in [50g tins](https://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/dunhill/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=278) and in [bulk](https://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/dunhill/bulk/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=19050) at SmokingPipes.com.
