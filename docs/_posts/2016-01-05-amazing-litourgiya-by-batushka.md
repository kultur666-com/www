I discovered lately *Litourgiya* by **Batushka** (meaning “Father”) a Black Metal band from Poland. Although their songs are sensibly named the same, differencing by only a number, *Yekteniya* (meaning “Litany”) 1 to 8, we can feel the mighty power of their inspiration in Othodox ritual chants with Black Metal being the main musical genre.

Their song set is majorly assembled with the most poignant songs at the beginning of the album. Although an overly good album, the most ear catching and greatly written songs are the second and third ones:

- Yekteniya 2
- Yekteniya 3

*Yekteniya 1* starts the album with a blasting beat setting the main pace to the two fabulous following songs. The following songs, *Yekteniya 2* and *3* are the main pieces that gives the value to the album and setting them as an interesting band for more to come.

*Yekteniya 3*, a sublime melodic &amp; dark song. My favourite.

The rest of the album is moderately interesting, although the songs could have been worked to include better and more melodic riffs as the second and third songs have been written.

We can expect greater albums from **Batushka** in the following years but their first one sets the pace for a fructuous career if they don’t discontinue their formation.

You can find the album on [witchinghour.pl store](http://store.witchinghour.pl/batushka-litourgiya-slipcase-digi-pack-p-6421.html).
