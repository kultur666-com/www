Out today November 10th 2016 is self-released ‘***Invasion Of The Tentacube***‘ by **Xoth**.

A band from Seattle, USA, these former members of *PHALGERON*, *WARBRINGER*, and *LECHEROUS NOCTURNE* are united to present us their second full-length album, ‘***Invasion Of The Tentacube***‘; a delicious combination of death metal, black metal and thrash metal that can be summed as a blackened death metal album.

Well played, well written and well produced, ‘***Invasion Of The Tentacube***‘ is a great album that might project **Xoth** into the spheres of stardom, as the album has all the ingredients to be very popular among the metal heads.

Available on Bandcamp.
