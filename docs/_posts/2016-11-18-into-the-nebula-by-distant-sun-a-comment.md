Out this Friday November 18th 2016 is **Distant Sun**‘s ‘***Into the Nebula***‘ via **Metalism Records**.

A Russian band that must have done some Megadeth covers in the past, and if it hasn’t, it should have – If you’re into Megadeth’s thrashy sound you’ll be at home with **Distant Sun**.

With a voice like Dave Mustaine, *Alexey Markov* of **Distant Sun** plunges us, with his band mates, into a style that resembles a lot to Megadeth.

I kind of enjoy the album as Mustaine is one of my idols. So what else from **Distant Sun**? Well the songs are cool and catchy and if your into old school thrash and a fan of Megadeth, you’ll find joy listening to ‘***Into The Nebula***‘ album by **Distant Sun**. Available on Bandcamp.
