Out today, March 1st 2017, is self-released ‘***Butchering The Colossus***‘ by **Bear Mace**.

A death metal act from Chicago, USA, **Bear Mace** offers us a really cool album that is well produced and really well written.

With pounding catchy riffs and a mesmerizing guttural voice, ‘***Butchering The Colossus***‘ by **Bear Mace** is one of those album that catches your attention on the first listen and make you comeback for more.

Existing as a duo since 2012, they are now five members that should be throwing shows in your neighborhood very soon, so stay alert for **Bear Mace**‘s mention.

Highly recommended, available on Bandcamp.
