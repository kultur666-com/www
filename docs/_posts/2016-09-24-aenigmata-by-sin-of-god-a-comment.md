![artwork](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/artwork.jpg?w=680)Out yesterday, September 23rd 2016, was **Sin Of God**‘s new album ***Aenigmata*** via **Satanath Records** and **Murdher Records**.

A really good death metal album from Hungary, **Sin Of God** delivers a powerful album with kickass tunes.

Founded in 2004, they are a mature band that toured extensively last year. ***Aenigmata***, their second full-length album, is well written and the tracks are tight as it can be.

Wondering if they’ll visit North America? Me too, although they can be seen on the European continent as it is their homeland.

You can find **Sin of God** on Bandcamp for streaming and get their album in digital format or physical CD.
