![k6-icon-2.0-podcast](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/k6-icon-2-0-podcast.png?w=680)If you’ve subscribed to the **Kultur 666 Podcast** through a podcast client, please take note that the URL of the RSS feed has changed.

Starting <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 1st 2016</span> the host of the Kultur 666 Podcast will be Soundcloud and to subscribe and download the episodes through your favourite podcast client, it must be done with the following URL: <http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:203985226/sounds.rss>

If you’ve been listening through iTunes or the posts on kultur666.com, nothing has changed and nothing changes. You will still be able to listen and download the episodes through the episode posts in kultur666.com or through iTunes.

In addition, now you can follow us on **[Soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com/kultur-666)** and interact with our tracks. While you’re at it, take also a peek to what we listen to. (What?!? There’s tons of minimal techno?!?)
