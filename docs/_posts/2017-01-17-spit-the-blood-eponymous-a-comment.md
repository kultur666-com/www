Out last May 22nd 2016 was **Spit The Blood**â€˜s eponymous album via **Symbol Of Domination**.

A thrash metal act from Athens, Greece, **Spit The Blood** delivers their first full length album which shows them as a promising band.

Reminiscent of some old Anthrax and late 80s thrash bands, expect some good old thrashing beats and groovy tunes.

Available on Bandcamp.
