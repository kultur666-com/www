Cool new band with screeching vocals and punkish-grindcore, **Hässlig**. I haven’t found much info on the band. Their new realease **Guillotine**, which came out this year’s November 26th, is interesting enough to remember them and hope for some more releases in the future.

A cool, dark album! Enjoy!
