Out today Monday February 27th 2017, is the reissue of ‘***Nothing to Lose***‘ by **Battalions** via **Black Bow Records**.

An album released originally in 2016, ‘***Nothing to Lose***‘ by **Battalions** is an album that solidly rocks.

A sludge act from Great Britain,’***Nothing to Lose***‘ by **Battalions** is their first full-length album, and from my understanding, they are on the verge or releasing something this year.

So while waiting for their next release, relax and have a pounding rock’n’roll in your face with ‘***Nothing to Lose***‘ by **Battalions**. Available on Bandcamp.
