Out tomorrow, Friday February 24th 2017, is ***Wilt*** by **Mordbrand** via **Carnal Records**.

A Swedish death metal band on their second full-length album, ***Wilt*** is **Mordbrand**â€˜s most mature album where, after many splits, some EPs and a previous first full-length album released in 2014, **Mordbrand** presents us a very well produced album with highly polished songs.

A very good album to have in your playlist, lets hope they put the album on Bandcamp and Spotify very soon.
