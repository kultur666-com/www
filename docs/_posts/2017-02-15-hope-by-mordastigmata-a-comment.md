Out this Friday, February 17th 2017, is ***Hope*** by **Mord’A’Stigmata** via **Pagan Records**.

A band from Poland that is in between black metal, blackened death metal and post metal, **Mord’A’Stigmata** offers us a journey of dark emotions, which the main brain of the band, Static, tries to explain in the brief following citation, that their music is more than simple black metal songs:

> \[…\] *This is what this record is about. It is hard for me to call the music on “Hope” black metal. Anyway, I get the impression that the term is frequently abused and given a wrong meaning nowadays. As usual, we came up with a mixture of styles to be named by people wiser than us. We play more with hearts than with heads and do not intend to play someone we are not. And that’s actually what “Hope” is, the music of pure emotions*.

In all, ***Hope** by **Mord’A’Stigmata*** is a good dark album of four songs (which the majority runs for near or over 12 minutes) and, along with a great other band, Obscure Sphinx, they are touring this spring to present their new album, and we hope, they’ll have great success as such album deserves.

A must to have on your playlist, available on Bandcamp.
