Once in a while there’s an album that comes out and you’ll listen to it the first time and some melody rings in your ears telling you: “Oh boy, I think I have found a good one”. And it happened to me with Hail Spirit Noir’s album “*Oi Magoi*” which came out in 2014.

Its genre is defined as progressive black metal, but I prefer to name the genre to *Progressive Black Rock*. Now, I haven’t crossed many other bands that can play this style of music except last year’s Tribulation’s “*The Children of the Night*“. My bad? No, unluck.

After all, I’m pretty much on my own with some limited channels for accessing music and iTunes, while being a somewhat mainstream channel, is still unavailable on Linux/Ubuntu.

They deliver 7 songs out of which 5 are of genius composition. Here’s *The Mermaid* which I can’t stop to whistle lately.
