![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cover2.jpg)Out this Friday, September 30th 2016 is **Eufori**‘s ‘***Humörsvängningar’*** via **Black Lion Records** label.

Featuring members from *Mist Of Misery*, they founded **Eufori** early 2016 to assemble songs from riffs that didn’t fit into the style of *Mist Of Misery* but had a potential to find fans.

A Depressive Suicidal Black Metal in style, we also find jolly melodies along lugubrious vocals, giving the album a style of its own.

You can explore the following Bandcamp widget and have an idea of your own.
