![Pentarium-Schwarzmaler-Cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pentarium-schwarzmaler-cover.jpg?w=680)

Out this September 9th 2016 is **Pentarium**‘s first signed full-length album ***Schwarzmaler*** available through **Boersma Records**.

Founded in 2006, they survived through some lineup changes and after some local recognition they went through two self releases; first ***The Avenger*** EP released in 2009 and ***Blood For Blood*** released in 2012.

Being from Germany, they revolve around some death metal and melodic black metal style although proclaiming themselves as a dark metal band.

***Schwarzmaler*** is an interesting album where melodic synths and catchy riffs go along well, producing a good album that we connect to it immediately. The lyrics are mostly in German as we also like.

Available today, visit **Boersma Records** and **Pentarium**‘s Website for more info on obtaining the album. I’ll update this post if there’s any Bandcamp streaming available.
