I’m fortyish and it’s only been about 15 years that I discovered David Bowie. First there was *Space Oddity* which I had already heard in the past but I then started to love the song and I dwelt a bit more into its music.

One of my favourites is *Velvet Goldmine*. It might be because of my follish past or some psychedelic stuff I took when I listened to that song but it got stuck in my head until now and it will keep resonating.

I remember one of my ex-girlfriends buying one of his 90’s albums when it came out, Hours… I think. Its music rang in the apartment making Julie very happy and me more open to other genres than Death Metal and all Metal genres related. And I remember hearing about his other creativities. In full he was a jewel of Earth’s creations.

He’ll be remembered for all his art and his personas. It would have been great to see him on stage in his 80’s, like some of them will do and we, the X generation, will enjoy.

Rest In Peace David, you won’t be forgotten.
