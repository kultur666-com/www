Out tomorrow, Friday January 27th 2017, is ‘***Reign of Terror***‘ by **Acranius** via **Rising Nemesis Records**.

A brutal slamming death metal act from Rostock, Germany, **Acranius** produced this third full-length album and, as such brutal death metal bands, they really get us slammin’ and get hungry for more.

As for slam, I don’t know what is the secret of this musical recipe, but I generally love the style and never tire of it.

Well produced, ‘***Reign of Terror***‘ by **Acranius** is what you need in your next playlist. Available on Bandcamp and Spotify.
