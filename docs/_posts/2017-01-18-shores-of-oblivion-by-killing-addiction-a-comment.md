Out last November 25th 2016 was ‘***Shores of Oblivion***‘ by **Killing Addiction** via **Xtreem Music**.

A death metal act from Florida, USA, since 1989, they split up in 1998 but came back in 2006 to re-garnish the extreme metal scene and are back with an interesting EP that should please the fans of death metal.

**Killing Addiction** lost one of their founding members, Chad Bailey, last September, so 2016 wasn’t necessarily a good one, although they gained momentum.

A good album to have in your playlist, ‘***Shores of Oblivion***‘ by **Killing Addiction** is available on Bandcamp.
