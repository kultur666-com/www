Out today Friday November 11th 2016 is ‘***Graves of Ceaseless Death***‘ by **Ruinous** via **Dark Descent Records**.

A death metal album from previous members of Funebrarum, ‘***Graves of Ceaseless Death***‘ is a solid album featuring some thrashy sound and, once in a while, some doomish style.

The production is well done, a high quality sound with good riffing and musicianship. A sure win if you’re looking for some new death metal. Available on Bandcamp.
