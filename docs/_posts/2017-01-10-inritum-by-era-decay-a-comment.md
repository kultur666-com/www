Out last November 11th 2016 was self-released ***Inritum*** by **Era Decay**.

A Romanian melodic death metal band, they present us an album that surely grooves and is also melo-aggressive.

Although not found easily, you are asked to seek this album as it contains really nice songs that should be accessible to all.

Unfortunately not found on Bandcamp.
