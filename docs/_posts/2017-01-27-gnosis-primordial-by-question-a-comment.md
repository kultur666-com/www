Out today, Friday January 27th 2017, is ‘***Gnosis Primordial***‘ EP by **Question** via **Chaos Records**.

A grind/death metal act from Mexico, **Question** delivers a good EP which is their second EP, if I’m not mistaken, after MMXIII and after their first full-length, ‘*Doomed Passages*‘, released in 2014.

Featuring fuzzy distorted guitars, a clear bass along the aggressive drum and gory vocals, the ‘***Gnosis Primordial***‘ EP has a lot of potential and **Question** is a band answering to be discovered. Available on Bandcamp.
