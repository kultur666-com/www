Out today August 26th 2016 is ‘***Our Distopia***‘ by **Martyrion**, a band from Cologne, Germany.

Having finished second at two contests in the last few years, they continued to play gigs around Cologne where they kept getting fans and make themselves noticed even more.

Now **Martyrion** seek your attention with their second full-length album, ‘***Our Distopia***‘ via **Boersma Records. A**fter their previous release, ‘**Refugium: Exile**‘, which is a rerecorded version of their first full-length album and launched last April 2016, they swim between melodic death, technical death and death thrash, to achieve a real feat up to their talent and release a solid and well executed album.

Listen to the following track, a song featured in ‘***Our Distopia***‘, available through **Boersma Records** today.
