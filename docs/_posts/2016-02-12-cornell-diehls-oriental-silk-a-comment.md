Overall a good Virginia smoke, Cornell &amp; Diehl’s Oriental Silk didn’t give me what I was expecting which was some odorant and flavourful Orientals.

Although I did notice the quality of the Virginias, I didn’t get any taste of Perique which is supposed to be available in this blend.

At one point I thought I was licking an armpit. Not sure if I should say this but for a tobacco I liked it. Hoping it was a female one…

Complex and simple is this blend. Recommended to experienced pipers and Oriental leaf lovers.
