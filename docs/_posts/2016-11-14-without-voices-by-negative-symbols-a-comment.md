If instrumental black metal is in your range of interest, there’s **Negative Symbols**‘ ‘***Without Voices***‘ album out this year which is well produced and offers an interesting side to black metal which isn’t common in the field.

A project by Benedikt Willnecker, former bassist of the band *Der Weg einer Freiheit* and *Ära Krâ,* where without limitations he puts down his songwriting talent to present us ‘***Without Voices***‘ which is an album that is as ambient and melodic as aggressive and melancholic.

For fans of CULT OF LUNA, DEAFHEAVEN or old OPETH, even if your into death metal you should like the ‘***Without Voices***‘ album by **Negative Symbols**.

You can find the album through the [band’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/negativesymbols/).
