Mac Baren’s 7 Seas Gold blend was the last of the 7 Seas blends that I tried.

On the first bowls, I didn’t get the taste of this blend. I was only getting a tingling on my taste buds in the second third of the bowls until I finished them. It wasn’t a pleasing experience.

One day I rolled a cigarette with this tobacco to finally find out that it had a vanilla casing. I think Mac Baren got this one wrong.

Besides the 7 Seas Black blend this one is also not in my favourite blends. Maybe one of the worst I smoked. Sorry Mac Baren.

Recommended to the experienced aromatic smokers. Some newbies might like it.
