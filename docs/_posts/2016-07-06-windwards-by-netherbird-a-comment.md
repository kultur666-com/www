![netherbird_windwards_single_2016](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/netherbird_windwards_single_2016.jpg)A single this one, ***Windwards*** by **Netherbird**.

Two black metal songs from this single and featuring a song, ***Sculptors And Spectres***, that will not be available on their coming lengthier album ***The Grander Voyage*** which will be available on **Black Lodge Records** this October 2016.

Sure to please the most black metal fan, both songs on this single are melodic and well recorded.

I invite you to listen to the following sample from bandcamp and to buy the single which is being sold for as cheap as 2$ USD. Be generous and give more!
