Out last September 28th 2016 was ‘***Door 218***‘ by **Balance Interruption** via **Satanath Records** and **Abstruse Eerie Radiance**.

An experimental black metal act from Kiev, Ukraine, don’t be fooled by any doubts about this album as it is a gem to listen to.

A merger of experimental metal, trippy metal and black and death metal, be ready to be transported into musicality and aggressiveness. The samples of Slavic discussions (I have no idea what it is being said) along the sax tracks, the guttural vocals and blasting drums makes this album a pure enjoyment to listen as it is refreshing as fun to have in our playlists.

Available with joy on Bandcamp and Spotify.
