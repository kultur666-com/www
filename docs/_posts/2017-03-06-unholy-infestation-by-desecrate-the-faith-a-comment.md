Out March 3rd 2017, was ‘***Unholy Infestation***‘ by **Desecrate the Faith** via **Comatose Music**.

A Texan death metal act with some angry music to share with us, be ready to revisit some old-school death metal à la *Suffocation* and *Chris Barnes* era *Cannibal Corpse*.

Very heavy but very reminiscent of good old days, **Desecrate the Faith** delivers totally with a powerful album of high quality death metal with a really good production.

Highly recommended, available on Bandcamp and Spotify.
