![netherbird_pillars_single_2016](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/netherbird_pillars_single_2016.jpg)Out today September 30th 2016, is **Netherbird**‘s second single ‘***Pillars Of The Sky***‘ via **Black Lodge Records**.

After ***Windwards***, their previous single, **Netherbird** leads us to their following full-length album ‘***The Grander Voyage***‘ available next October 28th 2016, with this single, ‘***Pillars Of The Sky***‘ including another song, ‘Brazen Splendour’, which is available only in this release.

A mix of 90’s death and black metal, expect a unique sound with Netherbird and their next album ‘***The Grander Voyage***‘. They are from Sweden and you can stream ‘***Pillars Of The Sky***‘ and ‘***Windwards***‘ via Bandcamp, and while you’re at it, be generous and buy those singles.
