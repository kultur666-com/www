**Lock Up** is back again with ***The Dregs of Hades*** – a really hot album that came out last November 26th, 2021.

I had really loved the previous release, ***Demonization***, where we were cuddled with the sweet vocals of **Kevin Sharp** (*Brutal Truth*), a really nice touch to the great riffs of the album – and guess what? He is back on this delicious new release with (fanfares!) **Thomas Lindberg** (*At The Gates*) co-sharing the lyric’s with Kevin.

Add **Shane Embury** (*Napalm Death*), **Adam Jarvis** (*Pig Destroyer*) and not to mention **Anton Reisenegger** (*Criminal*); we have an All Star Death Metal Band !

Dig it &amp; Enjoy!
