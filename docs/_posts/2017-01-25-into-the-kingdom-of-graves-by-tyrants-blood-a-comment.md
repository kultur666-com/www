Out last December 23rd 2016 was the re-issue of ‘***Into the Kingdom of Graves***‘ by **Tyrants Blood** via **Tridroid Records**.

The album is reissued in vinyl format with a digital download of the *Coven* album.

A death/extreme speed metal act from Vancouver, Canada, **Tyrants Blood** is well known for its aggressiveness and this reissue is a good example of the band’s output.

Founded in 2005, **Tyrants Blood** didn’t sleep on their laurels, releasing their first full-length album in 2006 and dropping down shows in Western Canada, Europe and South America all along. ‘***Into the Kingdom of Graves***‘ is **Tyrants Blood** third full-length album and we should expect another output from them soon, if they follow their release cycle.

You can order the vinyl on Bandcamp.
