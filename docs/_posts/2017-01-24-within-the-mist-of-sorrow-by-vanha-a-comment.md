Out last December 28th 2016, was ‘***Within the Mist of Sorrow***‘ by **Vanha** via **Black Lion Records**.

A doom/death metal act from Sweden, the duo of Jan Johannson (vocals, keyboards &amp; guitars) and Jesse Oinas (drums) delivers a powerful album that is majestic and tenebrous as it can be, with powerful drums and majestuous vocals.

The album is well produced and the musicianship is all percepted from the beginning of the album, ’till the end. A must have album if your into death and like slow tempo beats. Available on Bandcamp.
