Out today, Saturday February 25th 2017, is ***Allgegenwärtig*** by **Streams of Blood** via **Folter Records**.

A black metal duo from Germany, **Streams of Blood** released their third full-length album, ***Allgegenwärtig***, which is a dark album in the veins of old school Norwegian black metal but with a good production.

For the purest fans of black metal, ***Allgegenwärtig*** by **Streams of Blood** is an album that has the potential of becoming a classic as the riffs are catchy, the drums tight and steady and the vocals classic to black metal.

In the veins of Immortal, you can for the moment stream the previous albums of **Streams of Blood** while we wait for ***Allgegenwärtig*** to be online.
