![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cover4.jpg)Released on July 21st 2016 was **Phidion**‘s latest single ‘***Mother Pestilence***‘.

A blackened death metal act from Sweden, **Phidion** delivers a well produced single featuring three songs powered by aggressive beats and well arranged riffs which are sure to please most of metal fans.

The only con of this album is its shortness as the songs are well played, with catchy riffs, but ends too soon leaving us wanting for some more.

You can listen to **Phidion**‘s release through Bandcamp as I invite you to listen to the following streaming widget. Buy their album either CD or digital album.
