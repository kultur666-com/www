Out today, January 31st 2017, is ***Sacrosanct*** by **Epoch** via **Lavadome Productions**.

Originally released in digital format in 2015, ***Sacrosanct*** by **Epoch** is re-released in 2017 in CD format and available in digital format also on Bandcamp.

A death metal act from Belgium, ***Sacrosanct*** is **Epoch**â€˜s only release yet and a powerful one it is. Well produced, the album is musically inspiring and the vocals are guttural as it can be.

Generally a great album, ***Sacrosanct*** by **Epoch** is specially recorded with talent and innovation. A must to your playlist, you can find it on CD and digitally, as previously mentioned, on Bandcamp.
