Out today February 3rd 2017 is the re-issue of ***Phantasmagoria*** by **The Mist** via **Greyhaze Records**.

Originally released in 1989, ***Phantasmagoria*** was the kind of album that had all the potential of propulsion for a band like **The Mist** to gain worldwide recognition, but didnâ€™t get it for its unluck and mistreatment.

The album got its way as a thrash metal collectors item but it is now made newly available in North America and Europe as in CD and vinyl format, thankfully via **Greyhaze Records**.

A thrash metal act from Brazil, **The Mist** is a real gem to find out and any fans of thrash metal will surely pound themselves for not previously having known **The Mist**. Although **The Mist** is now a split-up band you can enjoy ***Phantasmagoria*** as an alternative to their comrades, *Sepultura*.

Available through [Greyhaze Records Website](http://store.greyhazerecords.com/index.phproute=product/product&product_id=463). Lets hope they make it available on Bandcamp and Spotify.
