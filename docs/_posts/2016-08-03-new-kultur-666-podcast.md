![k6-icon-2.0-podcast](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/k6-icon-2-0-podcast.png)Starting Wednesday August 3rd 2016, we’ll start producing a podcast featuring metal music.

We’ll share the podcast here on kultur666.com but, coming in the next few weeks, it will be available as a feed on different syndication services.

You’re invited to listen to **‘Kultur 666 Podcast’** if you’re into metal music and want to listen to new stuff either as it recently came out or is about to be launched. Some old stuff will also be featured.

Stay tuned!
