![spirit-of-the-forest-a-void-cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/spirit-of-the-forest-a-void-cover.jpg)Out today, October 5th 2016, is ‘***A Void Into The Fields Of Silence***‘ by **Spirit Of The Forest** via **Scum Productions**.

A black metal band from Québec, Canada, expect to hear old school black metal with **Spirit Of The Forest**‘s ‘***A Void Into The Fields Of Silence***‘.

Featuring songs in English and the other half in French, the album is also titled ‘**La Nature Oubliée**‘ (The Forgotten Nature), for its francophone half.

A really well produced album with well written songs, the spirit of the album revolves around northern themes. Although a bit less Nordic than our Scandinavian fellows and without “les Nordiques” also (blague), Québec is a niche of black and death talents, and **Spirit Of The Forest** lives up to their reputation.

In the vein of Emperor and Dissection, listen to the following Bandcamp streaming widget and buy this great album. We feel the cold of winter.
