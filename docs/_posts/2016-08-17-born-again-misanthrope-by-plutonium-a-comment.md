Covering **Plutonium**, is ‘***Born Again Misanthrope***‘, the third full-length album as an independent release.

Featuring a great dark musical composition, **Plutonium** plunges us into an flood of emotional emptiness where none gets us into.

**Plutonium**‘s previous release, ‘***Devilmentertainment non-stop***‘ released in 2011, shared some of the same subjects of the new release, but being up-to-date, ‘***Born Again Misanthrope***‘ will nourish the most modern open minded dark anthropist and engulf the deepest depressed being into a maelstrom of blackest emotions he can get.

Listen to the following Bandcamp stream and buy the album, a must for most Black Metal fans. Don’t forget to listen to ***Remuntiationem*** a great piece of artistic play by the only, **Plutonium**.
