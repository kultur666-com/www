Available on CD is **Vindlandâ€™s** latest: ***Hanter Savet***.

Black/Viking metal from France in its good way, **Vindland** offers us an album with catchy riffs and melodic songs.

They received some important praises around the globe from the Web and, no questions about it, they are to get some more until next album.

The formation is made up of four members from France; although they do not sing in French, but in Breton, an old language from Brittany.
