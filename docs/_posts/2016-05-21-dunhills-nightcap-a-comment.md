If you ever come across *Sutliff’s Tobacco Galleria: Night Cap* and wonder if it is a cheaper alternative to *Dunhill’s Nightcap*, don’t go any further: they’re completely different blends. Sutliff’s is a strong aromatic while Dunhill’s is an English blend.

If *Dunhill’s Early Morning Pipe* is a great blend to start the day, *Nightcap* is also a great blend to end it. Being a less spicy blend because of less Latakia, it contains Perique; adding a smoky aroma and flavour to the smoke.

As always I recommend Dunhill’s blends to the higher tobacco budgets, but novices are invited to try this fine blend as with all other Dunhill great blends.

> A rich blend for late in the day, Dunhill’s Nightcap is a slow, lasting smoke. Just prior to packing, expensive Perique tobacco is added to enhance the bouquet.
