![psychotron-lethal-paralysis-artwork](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/psychotron-lethal-paralysis-artwork.jpg)In an effort to make rise the thrash style again, I present you **Psychotron**, a thrash metal band from Bengladesh that has some potential to help revive the style in the oriental side of the planet.

Although still pending on its release date, I call onto you to help them achieve a feat of inflaming the thrash metal scene in Asia, and why not, help keep rising the style here on some future touring also.

They have an awesome potential and I’m asking you to be generous and pre-order their album so they can move on to the next production and help the band survive the harshness of the metal scene in their location. You can find the ‘***Lethal Paralysis***‘ album through the **Mortuary Records &amp; Distribution** label and on Bandcamp as we like it.
