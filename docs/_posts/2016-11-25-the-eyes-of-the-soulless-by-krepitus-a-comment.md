Out today, Friday November 25th 2016, is the self-released ‘***The Eyes of the Soulless***‘ by **Krepitus**.

A death/thrash metal act from Calgary, Canada, **Krepitus** shreds ‘***The Eyes of the Soulless***‘ powerfully with fierce devotion and angry attitude.

‘***The Eyes of the Soulless***‘ is **Krepitus**‘ debut album which is well produced and the songs are really well written.

A great album with good distortion and great vocals to have in your playlist and which is available on Bandcamp.
