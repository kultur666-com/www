Out July 15th 2016 was **Onirism**‘s ‘***The Well Of The Stars***‘ EP, a symphonic black metal album from the one French man project of Antoine Guibert.

Really well produced and really well written, we’re plunged into an enchanted world of fantasy where aggressiveness once in a while pops out and moves us in an epic exchange of mindset.

A Final Fantasy-esque voyage where we long for exploration and encounters with enchantment and wilderness.

Be transported by the following Bandcamp streaming widget and buy, as Antoine is a man of great talent.
