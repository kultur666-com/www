![riket-avarter-cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/riket-avarter-cover.jpg?w=680)

Here’s some fresh **Death Metal** from **Stockholm, Sweden** from a band known as **Riket.** They are launching what seems to be their first **EP** today (May 31st, 2016) and although containing only 4 tracks, one of them is quite interesting to listen to: **Lågor vid portarna**; being on its own a bargain for the price of the album.

Drums performed by **At The Gates** drummer, **Adrian Erlandsson**, and **Netherbird** guitarist, **Tobias Jakobsson**, the band seeks to innovate out of official stands.

With interesting vocals by **Johan Nephente Fridell**, they could be on their own an official act; although being kind of one by itself, members have their own official bands to not diverge full time into side project **Riket**. But who knows, time can tell and we can listen!
