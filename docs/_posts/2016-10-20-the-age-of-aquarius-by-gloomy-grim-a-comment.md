![151-1](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/151-1.jpg)Out last June 6th 2016 was **Gloomy Grim**‘s ‘***The Age Of Aquarius***‘ album via **Satanath Records** and **MurdHer Records**.

Essentially a symphonic black metal album, **Gloomy Grim** uses also thrash metal and death metal to spice up the album which is well produced and interesting to listen.

**Gloomy Grim** started in 1995 in Finland as a one-man project and developed into being a band that led to five full-length releases and a period of silence before they came back with ‘***The Age Of Aquarius***‘.

Using the theme of horror expect to be transported from song to song into a whirlwind of fantasy and agony. You can find **Gloomy Grim** on bandcamp.
