![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cover.jpg) Available for free on their Website today is **Pequod**â€˜s ***False Divinity*** an EP release after their full-length album ***Forgotten****.***

They offer us a melodic approach to their sound and, while their songs are well constructed, the vocals from Roland W. are all the way semi-deep-guttural as fans of death metal likes them.

Mixed by Fredrik Folkare (Unleashed, Necrophobic) at Chrome Studios (Sweden), the album is sure to please fans and new finders alike.
