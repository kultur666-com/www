Out, last October 28th 2016, was released ‘***On The Verge Of Dysfunction***‘ EP by **Speedwhore** via the **Witches Brew** label.

A blackened trash metal band from Germany, they have a full-length album up their sleeve released last year, and they now release this EP to update our ears and, with a good production, they manage to flourish the thrash scene with their own style.

With their blackish vocals and thrashy riffs and drums, ‘***On The Verge Of Dysfunction***‘ by **Speedwhore** is a refreshing album which is sure to please old-school and new thrash metal fans. Available on Bandcamp.
