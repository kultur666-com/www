Some fresh stuff!

**Lung Sewage** is a solo project by **Stelios Kyprianou** from Cyprus. His first album, as it seems to be, ***Bathed In Filth*** is a must to be listened.

The melodic riffs and his low grunting distorted voice makes the album a pleasure to be listened. Most of the tunes are catchy and the vocals are mesmerizing.

If Stelios can continue to produce more music, it will be interesting to follow him through his future progresses as he has ingenuously put down a great artistic debut effort.

Please listen to the following list and donâ€™t be shy to buy his album.
