One of my favourite aromatic blends until now, Peterson’s Luxury Blend offers a smooth citrus &amp; honey casing along with natural tobacco tastes.

Not available in bulk or higher weights than 50g, it is a luxury tobacco artfully blended which a lot considers to be of very high quality. I do.

I’m definitely getting some more in the future and I’m recommending it to novice and experienced pipers alike.

> A smooth and exquisite blend of three different Virginias, sweet Black Cavendish, fragrant Burley and a fabulous aroma of orange, Peterson’s Luxury blend features flavors of honey and a touch of the all-time favorite, vanilla.

Available in [50g tins](http://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/by-maker/peterson/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=2350) at SmokingPipes.com.
