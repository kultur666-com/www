A great Burley blend, Pegasus gives you everything you can expect from its kind of blend.

I’m more a Burley’s fan than a Virginia’s fan but you can’t remove the good Virginias from this blend or it will destroy it.

I recommend this blend for all newbies and experienced pipers alike. It will not displease you.

> C&amp;D’s Pegasus is yet another from the master of classic American Burley blends, Bob Runowski. Three Burley tobaccos, two Virginias and a touch of unsweetened Black Cavendish form a classic American blend, hearkening back to the days when Burley was king in American pipe tobacco blends.

Ordering some more for sure.
