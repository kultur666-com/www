Out last May 18th 2016 was ‘***Nocturnal Hymns To The Fallen***‘ by **Demonic Obedience** via **Satanath Records** and **Sevared Records**.

A death metal one-man project of George Ntavelas, ‘***Nocturnal Hymns To The Fallen***‘ by **Demonic Obedience** is a really cool album in its brutal guttural form where everything is blasted away in a well produced manner.

Yet, not one of those albums that lack in quality, it limits the artist to perform on stage as the musicianship should be seen rather than only listened. A really good death metal album in its whole.

To be in your playlist, you can find ‘***Nocturnal Hymns To The Fallen***‘ by **Demonic Obedience** on bandcamp.
