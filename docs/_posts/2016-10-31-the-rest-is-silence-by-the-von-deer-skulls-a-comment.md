Released today on Halloween, Monday October 31st 2016, is ‘***The Rest Is Silence***‘ by **The Von Deer Skulls** via **Wraith Productions**.

An excellent psych-prog metal band from 3 parts of the world – France, Germany and Canada – **The Von Deer Skulls** propulsive music sends us into a world of real fantasy and simili-chaos where we’re not shred into pieces but are flight-sick and at peace.

A delightful of diverse sounds where one is invited to drunkenness and ecstasy; like a good wine which we know we must not drink too much – but is so good.

To have in your playlist – absolutely.
