Launched this Monday, October 31st 2016, was **Soulemission**‘s ‘***Tales of Inevitable Death***‘ via **Black Lion Records**.

Essentially a black metal album, ‘**Tales of Inevitable Death**‘ navigates also onto the waters of thrash and death but remains a black metal album.

With solid rhythmic beats by *Menthor* (Enthroned, Lvcifyre, Nightbringer), **Soulemission**‘s album has strong elements to make it a good one to have in our playlists. Available on Bandcamp.
