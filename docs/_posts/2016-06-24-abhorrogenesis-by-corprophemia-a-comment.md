Out last March 2016 was **Corprophemia**‘s ***Abhorrogenesis***.

Offering us a technical brutal death metal genre, ***Abhorrogenesis*** is a complex album where songs are in low key and the riffs are not easy to be hummed.

As per [this guitar playthrough for the song ***Abhorrogenesis***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaFVi15RDpE), they play 8-string guitars, so the tunes are really low.

They master their songs really well and the drums are very tight along with a common death guttural singer.

As I usually say, I prefer easy melodies. This is an album for fans of technical brutal death metal that like to have their ear canals cleaned with this kind of music; here’s a sample of the album, Hour Of The Witch (crank it up!):
