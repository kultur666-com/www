I was my revelation last year. I wonder what will be this year.

Dark and deliciously tasty, Irish Flake is a wonderful tobacco. The tin note is leathery and once you get hooked on this tobacco you remember the tin aroma and are looking for some more once you finish it.

I’ve tried the Mac Baren’s Old Dark Fired Ready Rubbed but not the flake. Its leathery aroma is similar but you cannot compare ready rubbed with flake, especially the ODF Ready Rubbed is sliced thin, so more oxygen is mixed with the smoke. I’ll soon try the ODF flake a will be able to compare them, but until then, Irish Flake remains my favourite.

Oh to have some more right now… Soon I will. For the moment I’m still enjoying my ODF Ready Rubbed. Better than nothing…

On the tin it says “\[…\] recommended for the experienced pipe smoker.”. That is mainly because of the nicotine punch it gives so it is recommended to nicotine tolerante smokers. I usually smoke half a flake per bowl, which is largely satisfying for me and makes the tin dure a while longer. It has about 12 flakes per tin. I recommend the novice smoker to try it and to the experts I’ll ask: “Show me better…”.

> Peterson’s Irish Flake is a full-bodied blend made of equal proportions air-cured, flue cured, and dark fired. True to the pure tobacco taste, it’s recommended for the experienced pipe smoker.
