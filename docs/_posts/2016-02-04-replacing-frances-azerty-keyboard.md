Looks like France is looking into replacing its AZERTY Keyboard as it no longer seems to aid the French typpists as it asn’t been for a while.

There doesn’t seem to be a standard in the AZERTY Keyboard as there is with the QWERTY keyboard.

I for one use the Canadian Multilingual keyboard layout to write French. It might not be the ideal keyboard but it is compatible with the QWERTY keyboard as I use it also to write in English with the English US keyboard layout.

Although I have been intrigued by the DVORAK keyboard in the past, the BÉPO keyboard being an open-source alternative to the France’s AZERTY keyboard is also based on the DVORAK layout. It could be an interesting alternative for French-Canadians if ever rises the need to switch keyboard layouts for us also. To be followed.
