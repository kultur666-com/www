Out lately was ‘***No Restraint***‘ by **Tragic Cause** via **Human To Dust Records**.

A death thrash metal act from Germany, **Tragic Cause** are back with a third full-length album, powerful as never before.

With low distorted guitars and a groovy drum, you can expect ‘***No Restraint***‘ to be as heavy as Pantera, Slayer, Crowbar and Pro-Pain, where the vocals are similar to the both latter.

Recommended to fans of heavy thrash/groovy metal. If you’re looking for something new, look into **Tragic Cause**. Available on Spotify.
