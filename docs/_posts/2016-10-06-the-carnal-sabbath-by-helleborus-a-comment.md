![4_Panel](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/155-1.jpg)Out last June 17th 2016 was **Helleborus**‘ ‘***The Carnal Sabbath***‘ via **Satanath Records** and **Black Plague Records**.

A black/blackened death/doom metal project from the Houseman brothers of Manitou Springs, Colorado; expect a high quality metal from these two. Wyatt Houseman explores the vocals and is the lyricist and Jerred Houseman is behind all the instruments and the production.

Essentially a well written album, the compositions are a mix of melodic metal along a range of guttural low and raspy vocal performances. A great black/death album for a wide range of metal fans.
