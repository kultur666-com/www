A very spicy blend, Peterson’s Old Dublin English blend is not for the faint of heart.

Artfully blended, this tobacco is a nice alternative to other well known English blends as some do say, although I cannot name them having not tried them yet.

I enjoy more this type of blend as a first smoke in the morning. Being full spicy and being a good wake up companion, Old Dublin is sure to please the experienced pipers and intrigue the novice one.

To also be enjoyed with a strong tea; the way I best love English blends!

> Peterson’s Old Dublin blend is based on the cool, smoky aroma of Cyprian Latakia with Golden Virginia, aromatic Black Cavendish &amp; sweet Greek Oriental Basma grades.
