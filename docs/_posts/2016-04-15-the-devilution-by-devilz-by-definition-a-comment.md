If you enjoy power metal as I have for the last 20 years, you’ll enjoy hearing Devilz By Definition’s new album “*The Devilution*” which will come out April 22nd, 2016.

We can hear their source inspirations of Slayer, Pantera and Lamb of God, and melody wise they deliver good tunes to hum.

While my favourite track is “Rise and Fall” you can hear their next single “Know Thyne Enemy” in the following video.
