![048_1](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/048_1.jpg)Out February 27th 2016 was an interesting split album from two Costa Rican band: ‘***Bringers of Delusion***‘, featuring **Assailant**, a thrash metal act, and **Ubiquitous Realities**, a death metal band; album launched via **Symbol Of Domination Productions** and **Cavan Records**.

For the first half, **Assailant** brings amazing solos and fast rhythmic riffs that paves the way for the second part, led by **Ubiquitous Realities,** where they shred the rest of the album tearing everything down in guttural madness and terrific doom.

From two of the most promising metal acts from Costa Rica, expect a really powerful album full of talent and marvellous destruction. Listen for yourself with the following Bandcamp streaming widget and buy.
