Nothing major about the new version of Lightworks 12.6 except maybe the native export to Vimeo, but it is quite nice to see advances to this really cool Professional Non-Linear Video Editor available for Linux along as for Windows and OS X.

Furthermore a cool 40% rebate for a year license from today up until febuary 29th 2016 is available as a coupon somewhere over the Web. Catch it or write me to obtain it.
