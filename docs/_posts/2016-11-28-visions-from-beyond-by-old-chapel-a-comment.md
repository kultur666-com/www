Released last November 7th 2016 was ‘***Visions From Beyond***‘ by **Old Chapel** via **Chaos Records**.

A doomed death metal band from Ivanovo, Russia, the **Old Chapel** project is the brain child of Sergei (Drums) and Pavel (Vocals) in which it exists since 2010 and, after two previous releases, they are back with ‘***Visions From Beyond***‘ which is a powerful album well produced and well written.

In the veins of Dismember, **Old Chapel**‘s *****Visions From Beyond***‘** can stimulate your ears and brain to go through your days with rhythm and deep vocals. A good album to have in your playlist, they are available on Bandcamp.
