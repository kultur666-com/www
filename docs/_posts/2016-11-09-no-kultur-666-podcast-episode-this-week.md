Sometimes we end up changing a few things for the better and most the times that change is due to something new. The new thing is online music streaming such as Spotify, Google Play Music and Apple Music, as it grows into being more and more popular, and changing the rules of what was being known and done for decades.

So the old ways are moving to better, new ways. Not wanting to part with what was a fun way of sharing new music with you folks, but when with a single click we can have infinite lists of suggestions with all the available database of 30M+ songs, the old radio format of Kultur 666 Podcast just dies.

So, to go with a shaky week, we are not publishing the podcast this week and in the next few days weâ€™ll take the decision if it will continue or just stay dead.

Thanks for sharing, and !,,!\_ Metal On \_!,,!
