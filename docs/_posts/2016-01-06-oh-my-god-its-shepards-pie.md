A young lady named **Linzey Rae** with a great Metal voice has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCatiR7bl5WnhoPYF6Jtj46w) where we can enjoy her grunts on the mic over some Metal songs. At first I thought it was some lip syncing. As we can see with some further searching, she sings in a Metal band known as **[The Anchor](https://www.facebook.com/TheAnchorBand)**.

I don’t know where she gets her guts to sing with such a voice but I find her quite amazing.

Checkout this video where she sings and cooks for us a Shepard’s Pie:

You’ll find some info on The Anchor band on their Facebook page and on her YouTube channel:
