![005-443-0077](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/005-443-0077.jpg)This is my favourite blend to start the day. Rich in Virginia’s, medium on Orientals and heavy on Latakia, the blend starts on the first bowl third as mainly a mellow English blend and its spiciness builds up until the second third gets burning. Then, until the end of the last third, it becomes a mainly spicy smoke.

If you don’t like Latakia don’t try this one. But if you do, I recommend get a 1oz first to see if it is your kind of heavy Latakia blend.

> Lemon Virginias, Smyrna and other Orientals, and Latakia are combined in Sutliff’s Heavy English, which despite its name is rather lightly balanced as far as Latakia mixtures go — some even find it quite suitable as an “all day” type of smoke.

I’m suspecting that its Latakia is a lesser quality one but none the less it is a nicely blended English. As I said, I love starting the day in the morning with one or two bowls of it; as I have been doing so for almost a year.
