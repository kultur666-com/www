Out last December 15th 2016, was ***Kepler*** by **Aksaya** via **Satanath Records**.

A black metal act from France, **Aksaya** delivers a technically themed album, sung in French, where the production is all good and where the album is filled with distortion and vibrant beats all across the tracks.

Formed in 2013, ***Kepler*** is their second full-length album and Iâ€™m sure the album will know success as it is melodic and exotic at the same time.

For those looking new sounding black metal and original melodies, the album, ***Kepler*** by **Aksaya**, is available on Bandcamp.
