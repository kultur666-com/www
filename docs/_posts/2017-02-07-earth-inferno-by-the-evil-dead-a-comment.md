Out last January 31st 2017 was ‘***Earth Inferno***‘ by **The Evil Dead** via **Witches Brew** label.

A blackened heavy metal/hardrock band from Buenos Aires, Argentina, **The Evil Dead** achieves the feat to incorporate blackened vocals into rhythmic metal and rock’n’roll, that, with their fine ear to melody, they really makes us like the ‘***Earth Inferno***‘ album.

Citing my friend at Qabar:

> **The Evil Dead** has experimented such a sound that is having the grooves of Thin Lizzy, AC/DC and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the outstanding harmonies of Iron Maiden, the aggression of Motörhead and Bathory, and the tenebrosity of Dissection.

It is difficult to put better words than these.

Formed in 2006, ‘***Earth Inferno***‘ is **The Evil Dead** second full-length album. And as the band like to say it, get ready to get stung by “*Electric Evil Metal*” with ‘***Earth Inferno***‘.

Highly recommended. Available on Bandcamp.
