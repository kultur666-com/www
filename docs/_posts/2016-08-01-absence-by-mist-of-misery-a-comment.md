**Mist Of Misery** is releasing a new album early august (date not set as of this writting), ***Absence.***

A symphonic black metal album, ***Absence*** offers listeners an evolved **Mist Of Misery** where the duo ***MortuzDenatus*** and ******Phlegathon****** introduces us into a new era of songwriting with an atmospheric ambiance along with well written melodic pieces.

I havenâ€™t listened to the previous releases of **Mist Of Misery**, but ***Absence*** is their second full-length album and part of the members are of another respected band, **Hyperion**.

***Absence*** is to be released through **Black Lion Productions** early August, meanwhile you can listen to the streaming sample through Bandcamp.

Highly recommended for black metal fans and others.
