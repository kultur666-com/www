![003-039-0073](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/003-039-0073.jpg)Mac Barenâ€™s 7 Seas Red blend was my second try of the 7 Seas blends and a quite enjoying smoke it was!

Featuring a rich Cherry aroma and taste, it was also my first cherry aromatic pipe tobacco.

Although I enjoyed the full 16oz I had ordered, it is one of those tobaccos that I might never buy or order again.

The natural burley flavour did come through the puffs but its cherry taste was a bit too like candy.

> An aromatic blend of tobacco with light Brown Burleys, sweet rich Golden Virginias, and just the right amount of Black Cavendish from Mac Baren. 7 Seas Red packs just great! Upon lighting up, you will experience a sweet freshness and the light richness of wild cherry along with a very faint overtone of fruit.

Recommended to the pipers who enjoy aromatics.
