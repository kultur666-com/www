Out last January 31st 2017 in digital format, was ‘***In the Name of True Death Metal***‘ by **Morbid Messiah** via **Godz Ov War Productions**.

A death metal act from Mexico, **Morbid Messiah** released the album ‘***In the Name of True Death Metal***‘ early 2016 but by the quality of musicianship and the talent of the band, **Godz Ov War Productions** thought that such record should have more wide recognition and released worldwide for all to get their hands on it.

In the style of early 90’s death sound and song writing, **Morbid Messiah** achieved a fantastic production with’***In the Name of True Death Metal***‘ that is both refreshing and reminiscent of old times; when death metal was blossoming and we were thrashing all around.

Recommended to old death ears and young ones along. Available on Bandcamp.
