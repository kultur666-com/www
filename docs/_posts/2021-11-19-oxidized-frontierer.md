Released last 1st October 2021, **Frontierer** with their ever (memorable??? ðŸ¤£) slashing-distortion-riffs and string-pick-slides-zigzags tunes in a new 4th album release, **Oxidized.**

I had really liked their 3rd release, **Unloved**, it had something cringing all along and had lovable angerâ€¦ as we all like here.

Enjoy with clean ears: Might make earwax melt.
