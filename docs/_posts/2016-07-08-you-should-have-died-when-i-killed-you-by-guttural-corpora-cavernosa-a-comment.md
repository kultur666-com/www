![GHP036 - Guttural Corpora Cavernosa - cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ghp036-guttural-corpora-cavernosa-cover.jpg?w=680) A good slam/death metal band I’ve listened to lately is ***“You Should Have Died When I killed You”*** by **Guttural Corpora Cavernosa**.

Right in my style of favourite metal **GCC** delivers good beats and deep guttural vocals along rhythmic riffs that unmeshes your hair and keeps you rocking like good old bands such as **Cannibal Corpse** or lately, **Vulvodynia**.

Did I also say that they were from Taiwan? Well now you know. Coming out today July 8th 2016, don’t wait to buy their album which you can listen in the following bandcamp stream.
