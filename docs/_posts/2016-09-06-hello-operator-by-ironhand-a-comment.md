![z](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/z.jpg?w=680)Out today September 6th 2016 is **Ironhand**‘s ‘***Hello, Operator***‘ via **Xperiment XIII Records**.

An industrial metal album, **Ironhand**‘s ‘***Hello, Operator***‘ has well written songs with fine musicality and good rhythmic vibes.

Although the sound lacks a bit of refinement we can hear the potential of **Ironhand**. Let’s hope for a better sounding album in the future. The talent is plenty.
