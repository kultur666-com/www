Out yesterday, March 3rd 2017, was ‘***The Nature of Being New***‘ by **Bungler** via **Innerstrength Records**.

A hardcore act with punk influences from Buffalo, New York, USA, **Bungler** delivers a massive third full-length album that is refreshing and strapped to bleed your ears.

A really powerful album that rocks and thrashes; the guitars are punky-grungy, the vocals are harsh and ruff and the distortion is to the max. Good rock beats and great wicked metal.

Loved it and recommend it. To have in your playlist absolutely. Available on Bandcamp and Spotify now.

Have a listen:
