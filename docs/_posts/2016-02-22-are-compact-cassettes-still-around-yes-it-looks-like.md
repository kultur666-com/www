I still remember buying my first Death Metal cassette of Napalm Death – Utopia Banished. And I do remember spend evenings doing cassette remixes for what we were going to listen the next day at work. It was the early nineties.

Then came the CDs and it killed the cassette. I found this article this evening and I’m surprised that there is still a demand for analog compact cassettes.

> Here’s a film from Bloomberg TV about the last Compact Cassette factory in the world. And you know what? They’re busier than ever. Their biggest issue is keeping these decades-old machines working.
