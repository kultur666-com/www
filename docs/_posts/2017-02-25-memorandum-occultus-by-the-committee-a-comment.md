Out today, Saturday February 25th 2017, is ‘***Memorandum Occultus***‘ by **The Committee** via **Folter Records**.

A black doom metal band from originally Belgium, **The Committee** is now a multi-origin band of Europe where they put there efforts into this really great album.

An album where melodic riffs along steady aggressive drums and guttural vocals make up a classic death/black/doom metal album to be.

Versing into a legacy of knowledge transcended onto future generations of man, ‘***Memorandum Occultus***‘ is to be known as a resource of diabolical rules for the enslavement and genocide of many.

‘***Memorandum Occultus***‘ is the second full-length album of **The Committee** and lets hope it appears on Bandcamp very soon. Highly recommended.
