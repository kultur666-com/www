![zornheym_the_opposed-1400x1400](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zornheym_the_opposed-1400x1400-1.jpg?w=680)Out last August 19th 2016, was the single ‘***The Opposed***‘ by **Zornheym** via **Non Serviam Records**.

Founded by an ex-bassist of Dark Funeral, Zornheym is completed by full-professional musicians with lots of background and know how. The result? A full scale epic symphonic black/death metal album that is in the works and ‘The Opposed’ is its first single to come out and give us a taste of the awaiting album.

So for the moment we’ll listen to ‘The Opposed’ a couple of times, but still, we can’t wait too long for the future album to come out. When? Which? I’ll let you know more when we’ll have the info, so stay tuned and listen to the following Bandcamp streaming widget and buy!
