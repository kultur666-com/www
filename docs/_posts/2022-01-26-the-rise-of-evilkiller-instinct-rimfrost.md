The Swedish band **Rimfrost** are back, returning with a 2-piece single, ***The Rise Of Evil​ : ​Killer Instinct*** released independently *January 6th 2022*.

After the splitting of the band in 2019, they came back to the studio in 2021 to record ***Killer Instinct*** (released in 2021) and these two songs which in all follows the theme of their previous album ***Expedition : Darkness*** released in 2019.

The songs are reminiscent of Scandinivian *Blackened *Heavy** *Metal*.

Enjoy!
