![cover](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cover10.jpg?w=680)Out this September 2nd 2016 is **Saddiscore**‘s ‘***Deamons Of The Earth***‘ via **Boersma Records**.

In the veins of classic heavy metal with a touch of contemporary heavy style and sound, **Saddiscore** shreds this album with ease giving us catchy tunes and thundering drums.

Although not in the style of aggressive siblings presented on this site, **Saddiscore** still can please your metal ears.

Founded in 2011, they got the attention of their local fans and embarked into a journey that led them through a demo and the EP ‘***Roots Of Fear***‘ along with some festivals. They are from Cologne, Germany and lets hope they pursue their endeavour with a bit more darkness, as we like it.
