Out last September 20th 2016 was ‘***Due Diaboli Et Apocalypse***‘ by **SevenSins** via **Satanath Records** and **MurdHer Records**.

A symphonic blackened death metal album by an amazing band from Kazakhstan that delivers powerfully like Dimmu Borgir and its siblings.

Formed in 2008 we are left wondering if we’ll hear more about this amazing band. Info is scarse and obscure but we do know that they sing about the medival times of their country and its alentours. Fortunately available on Bandcamp.
