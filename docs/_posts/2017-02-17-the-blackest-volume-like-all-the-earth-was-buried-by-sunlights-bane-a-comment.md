Out today, Friday February 17th 2017, is ‘***The Blackest Volume: Like All The Earth Was Buried***‘ by **Sunlight’s Bane** via **Innerstrength Records**.

A grindcore act from Michigan, USA, **Sunlight’s Bane**, once known as *Traitor*, are releasing a really powerful album which, if I’m not mistaking, is their first full-length album preceded by an EP, *Shadowheart*, and where they pour all things aggressive and revolting into a jam packed 53-minutes, 11 songs record.

A really inspiring album where we hear aggressive melodies highly distorted be grinded along harsh vocals that sums up in all as a great grindcore record.

Highly recommended, ‘***The Blackest Volume: Like All The Earth Was Buried***‘ by **Sunlight’s Bane** is available on Bandcamp.
