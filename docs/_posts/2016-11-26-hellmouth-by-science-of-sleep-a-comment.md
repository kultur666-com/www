Out yesterday, November 25th 2016, was ***Hellmouth*** by **Science of Sleep** via **Bastardized Recordings**.

**Science Of Sleep** has put down a serious second full-length album, after three years of touring, which is a mix of death metal and deathcore.

Brutal in all its sense, ***Hellmouth*** reaches to extremes to vehiculate **Science Of Sleep**‘s lyric themes, which are about the dark human nature and hell mythologies.

You can find **Science of Sleep**‘s albums on Bandcamp.
