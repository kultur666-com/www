Hello, I'm Seraf, aka Citadin 5, aka DJ Citadin V, aka syr3f.

I'm the maintainer of kultur666.com: basically a Website about human vices and non-recommended principalities. Even though I am mainly inspired by my obsessions, I try to incorporate other subjects which I think are aspects of human sin and passion.

You'll mainly find subjects on tobacco, metal and techno music, with once in a while subjects on computer science and diverse cultural informations.

I live a simple life lately in, mostly in a basement where I spend some time outside of it smoking my pipe or talking to squirrels (yes, literally, or squirrelally).

I studied computer science a few years ago, worked as a computer technician and Web developer and now spend mostly my time contemplating my thoughts, listening constantly to new metal bands and spending too much time learning and searching on tobacco pipes and pipe tobacco, and many other interests of my own.
