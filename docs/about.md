Hello, Iâ€™m Seraf, aka syr3f, and Iâ€™m the maintainer of kultur666.com.

![Me, Seraf aka syr3f](../assets/images/comicwebcam-photo1-reversed.jpeg)

kultur666.com is a zine covering extreme metal music. Although youâ€™ll mainly find comments on metal albums, I try to maintain the style of extreme metal music reviews to black metal, death metal, thrash metal and other non-clean singing music.

You might find other types of posts on kultur666.com, for legacy reasons, or other interest reasons, although I try to keep the main subject of extreme metal music in its most simple form.

**Promoters, bands and labels are welcomed to send me their promos.**
